Members are struggling to sleep, that is why we moved the sport session, knowing that the weather did not allow us to go outside in the morning. We did all the cleaning work on the hab, the GreenHab, the science dome and the RAM. As we had to Unmount our LOAC and MegaAres, the crew worked on the Human Factor experiment in the late morning.We went out with a lot of wind and after 4 weeks of hard labour, the weather station fell down one hour before we were supposed to unmount it. but no worries, nothing is broken. The EVA was not so easy because of the wind.We washed all the materials and we went out of sim.

For the EVA, the crew explored the extreme North region of the campus. They were satisfied with what they have found. Red soil was everywhere and it made Marion happy. During the EVA, the three members in the hab prepared a joke for Florian. Indeed, they put a Jalapeño pepper inside his bread for lunch. This was a really funny moment, and with the bad news from the outside world it is good to share this. Then we talked a lot about the Covid19 consequences on the end of our year. Our school has been officially closed and those who were supposed to go to Costa Rica, Guyane or Italy are thinking about alternatives.We stay really close from each other, which helps us to keep our spirit up!Look Ahead Plan : Un-mount the outdoor experiments.Anomalies in work: None.Weather: cloudy in the morning, 0°C at 7:30am then cloudy and sunny in the late afternoon, 14°C at 7:00pmCrew Physical Status: All crew members safe and sound.EVA: LOAC and MegaAres batteries changed, Northern region exploredReports to be filed: Journalist report, Operations report, EVA request, Green Hab report, EVA report, Astronomy report."

Having a day without an exploration EVA and aphysical activity tomorrow is a good choice for the crew mental andphysical status. I don’t think it is mandatory for the scientificpurposes of our mission but it is the better way to have an efficientand satisfying second week.The daily EVA has been a new experience for me. Dealing with theefficiency of communication has been interesting. We have proved that aroutine EVA can be performed with its complexity without saying a singleword. The protocol is complex to but not that hard to set up. I want tothank Luc for having followed me on that idea. We explored the easternregion of Reservoir Dam. The biodiversity there was completely differentfrom what we have been used to.The oven has been set up outside and even without a perfect sun weheated 600mL of water from 10°C to 67°C in 2 hours. We will give moredetails in the future science reports.

crew 221 - 13/02/2020,"Today the crew woke up and had pancakes prepared by the crew commander and with the olive oil we got from the last supply mission from Earth. Finally, they do not stick to the pan anymore and were delicious!In the morning we were under the gun to get the robot ready as there were hookups with the software. All bugs were solved by 13:00, leaving one hour before the EVA.The girls EVA team, containing the crew commander M.Grulich, crew journalist H. Kalucha and crew GreenHab Officer J. Todd who mainly worked on the robot, got ready for the EVA. They decided to test the robot just in front of the hab door to make sure it was working. It did but the wheels came loose, and it had to be fixed in the field. This was a real challenge, requesting several tools from the team support inside the hab.Once all issues were fixed the EVA team headed for the rover but realized that Spirit was not plugged in. After radio communication, it was decided to leave one team member at the hab and go with permission with two crew members on Curiosity. Crew commander and crew GreenHab officer drove to Steambed Connector and walked to Candor Chasma and tested the robot successfully in a more challenging environment.Once back the team had a debrief discussing the communication and confusion of information that lead to one person not joining the EVA mission and realized that any piece of information from mission support should and shall in the future be reviewed and read in more detail, as we cannot rely on mission support on Mars.The evening was spent with a lovely salad prepared by crew HSO Rawan Alshammari and will be concluded with a games night.Anomalies in work: NoneUpdate mouse in hab: no new mice caughtWeather: sunny light windsCrew Physical Status: Crew some sore throat, but seems to improveReports to be filed:Sol SummaryPhoto ReportOperations ReportJournalist ReportGreenHab ReportEVA RequestEVA Report 13"
crew 221 - 12/02/2020,"Update since last Sol summary: The crew finally managed to have one games night which made everyone happy. Still in the wish list – movie night and dance night.Today we reconvened for breakfast, enjoying good conversations before preparing for our only EVA of the day!Crew commander M. Grulich, Crew Journalist H. Kalucha and Crew Greenhab Officer J. Todd went out for an EVA to install the antenna of the crew engineer.The antenna was installed in two different places without an issue showing that such an antenna could be deployed on Mars! On the way back, the EVA team lost Fuzz, our mascot, and had to go back and rescue him! He feels like a real team member right now and the crew was scared for a second and was glad when he was found again. The team also recorded some shoots for a dance video on the EVA that was also continued in the hab: stay tuned!After the EVA the team took a little break before heading into the robot project which needed an operation on its heart, since the raspberry pi seemed to not have been configured appropriately. The robot had to be disassembled partially to reach the LAN cable which tested the patience of Crew Journalist, the crew commander and Crew Greenhab officer. After almost giving up and letting the robot win, Crew Engineer L. Monge came to the rescue with his external monitor and keyboard as the issue was that the country and wifi was not configured.Finally, the team saw some progress. The second batch of the microbiology samples also showed sign of microbes.Tonight, we will have the last cultural night, Germany, and the crew commander prepared “Knödel mit Soße” and brought the most famous drink of Germany… “Apfelsaftschorle” which is apple juice with gas, a much-loved drink in Germany besides beer! Also, the crew will experience the Cologne Catherdal with VR glasses.Anomalies in work: NoneUpdate mouse in hab: no new mouse caughtWeather: sunny light windsCrew Physical Status: Crew with knee issues is feeling better, some crew members experience worsened sore throatsReports to be filed:Sol SummaryPhoto ReportOperations ReportJournalist ReportGreenHab ReportEVA RequestEVA Report 11Journalist Report"
crew 221 - 11/02/2020,"Update since last Sol summary: The crew had a lovely Canadian/Indian Cultural night, learning about two cultures and getting our names written in Hindi.Today we woke up and wrote our wish list for the activities we would love to do with our remaining time on Mars. Number one is movie night, games night and salsa night as we keep on postponing it due to the high number of projects we would like to achieve. We still have 4 days and only one cultural night left.The first EVA in the morning left just 15 min late as one of the wishes from the commander was to take the EVA checklists more seriously. Still the EVA Support team forgot to put a camera in the airlock, which caused the EVA team to do the depressurization twice.Once on the road, the EVA team managed to install the antenna on the desired location and achieved all their objectives. The rest of the crew was working on finishing the robot and managed to see it turning on for the first time. Unfortunately, the crew could not manage to connect to the robot and has to troubleshoot further tomorrow. For lunch, the team had tortilla bowls with fresh mung bean sprouts that the crew grew over the last couple of days. Mung beans are a powerhouse of vitamins such as A,B,C and E as well as minerals calcium, magnesium, potassium and phosphorous. It also contains zinc, chromium, iron and they taste very fresh and like peas, which is great for Martians in confined space.Also, today the inherited Kambucha batch of crew 220 should be ready to be drunk by the crew. A first try will be done tomorrow.During the afternoon, the EVA team got delayed one hour as the crew only had four EVA radios and two of them had been used before and were not recharged in time. In addition, the crew made a mistake in the EVA window and so when the team was finally ready to go, the team was informed that the EVA window is already over. Therefore, the EVA was canceled.The free time was used to take four crew members’ profile pictures, work on the sample catalogue of the microbiology samples and identify the bacteria based on their appearance such as, form, elevation, surface, opacity and color. The samples from February 3rd were then discarded to avoid any bad bacteria growth. As we are working on fulfilling our wish list, we will have a games night tonight, after a lovely dinner with fresh salad and cucumber from the Greenhab harvested by J.

Alotaibi, so all other crew members had a chance to ask questions and learn about it which was great!This morning Crew Engineer L. Monge and Crew Commander M. Grulich went up the Hab Ridge road towards Hab Ridge North to get eight more microbiology samples as well as investigate how two different EVA teams with the same route and the same objective will perform.The morning EVA already struggled to find the Hab Ridge road but managed after two extra little hill hikes. The team found great samples of stones with letch, several stratospheric layers and gryphaea at the top of Hab Ridge Road North, supporting the theory that Mars once hosted liquid water. We already know there are microbes living in the soil from the already incubated samples showing bacteria and fungi growth. Meanwhile, H.Kalucha and J. Todd worked on the robot and almost finished it, which just leaves the programming to be done tomorrow.In the lunch break between the two EVA’s, we found out that we actually caught our little Martian and we called the rodent Kim and got permission to release him at Cowboys Corner at the end of EVA 9.The second EVA of the day also had an issue finding the road, but still managed to find it and also collected 8 samples which will be processed today. Crew Commander prepared nutrient agar during the second EVA while being support lead to finish all samples by today to leave enough time for the incubation.Once the second EVA team came back, they took the rovers to release Kim.

Kalucha before heading to an early night’s sleep.Today, half the crew ( J.Todd, R.Alshammari, G. Alotaibi) went on an EVA towards Candor Chasma ,walking along Stream Bed Connector. The weather was beautiful and sunny and actually, the team reported that they were a bit too warm under the space suits. They did not achieve all their objectives but identified places to use the rover on future EVAs.The other half of the team was staying in the hab. L. Monge and H.Kalucha were working in the science dome on soil health experiments, investigating the quality of the Martian soil being used to grow black corn. They attempted to determine if the black corn and mung beans have a chance to survive.Commander M.Grulich was working on the oven issue, reading through the manuals and communicating with mission support to find a solution to our high propane measurements in the upper deck. The hypothesis was that the oven was not configured to be used with propane gas as the gas pressure regulator showed no change in configuration. Mission support was very helpful, checking information about the oven speedily, and eventually came to the same hypothesis.In the afternoon, Crew 221 got external support and together with Dan, configured the oven to be used for propane. Since then, the flames of the stove are way smaller and the oven does not trigger the gas detector anymore. There are also no visible flames in the oven anymore, so the issue is solved!This afternoon, the team worked on planting mung beans in the Greenhab that hopefully sprout soon. The crew already set a jar of mung beans aside that are sprouting since today to be hopefully ready to eat within the next couple of days.Crew Engineer worked on his antenna project and managed to receive some signals from Arizona. Last but not least the microbiology experiments seemed to show first signs of growth on the soil samples.

The main take-away is that in Australia everyone is your “mate” and you have to help them just like on Mars.This morning, the commander woke up the team to prepare for another long EVA to go to Candor Chasma, which the crew expects to have been formed by water. The EVA team left at 10:00 am and had beautiful weather and the geology of Candor Chasma was very interesting. There were several stratigraphic layers, from which the crew took samples and will try to grow bacteria.In the afternoon, the team worked on their robot under the eyes of “Fuzz” and made good progress besides one little piece broke off, which has to be glued before the team can continue and probably finish the robot tomorrow.The samples in the incubator currently only show bacteria growth on the sample of the spacesuit before cleaning. This is also a good sign, since it means the crew is working cleanly. Today, they also produced agar, which was successful this time. All samples have been weighed and tomorrow, they will be processed to grow microbes. Tonight, there will be pizza prepared by the Crew Journalist H.

No big evening activities were planned as the crew needed some good night sleep to refill their batteries. The discussions between the crew members, however, become more and more interesting each day.This morning, the commander woke up the team with “starships” by Nicki Minaj to get the team up and running and also prepared pancakes with fresh banana for the crew.After a short team meeting to plan the day, the crew teamed up in pairs. Crew Engineer L. Monge and GreenHab Officer J.Todd focused on ISRU plant experiments in the GreenHab to plant black corn in different soils taken during yesterday’s EVA from different places. Crew Journalist H. Kalucha and Crew Astronomer G. Alotaibi started to build the crew robot in the RAM that shall be tested once ready during EVAs, even though several crew members dropped by to help as everyone was excited to build it. Crew Commander M.Grulich and HSO R. Alshammari were preparing the soil samples from the last EVA and inspecting the petri dishes from yesterday. They were positively surprised to find the first signs of bacteria growth from the sample of the EVA space suit before it was cleaned.

crew 221 - 05/02/2020,"Update after last sol summary: crew 221 Earth2Mars had their first sport session, meditation session and cultural night on Mars. The GreenHab Officer J.Todd made the team sweat for 30min using the distilled water containers as weight. Afterwards the team enjoyed their first meditation session, taking a moment to breath and slowdown in our busy day. Following this, the crew astronomer G. Alotaibi and HSO R. Alshammari took the crew to the middle east (Kuwait), explaining traditions and how to dress in the desert using ghutra and ougal that are traditionally used for men. L. Monge then successfully dressed himself Kuwaiti style, based on what we learnt! The team learned a lot and it was just supposed to be a 10 min activity which lasted for hours. R.Alshammari wrote all the crew names in Arabic and we got a lesson on how to count in Arabic using hindi alphabet, which was interesting as the Western World uses Arabic letters. The cultural night finished with an unexpected visit of a small mouse-looking-Martian, which we will try to catch alive in the coming days to release in the wild.The whole day of Sol 3 was allocated to exploring the Martian surface for traces of life as well as taking samples to grow plants in the Martian soil. EVA team one with M.Grulich, L.Monge, J. Todd took out the rovers to the Moons, searching for traces of water. During the EVA, they found what looks like water channels and saw bubbles in the soil which can be an indicator for microbes’ activities which made the team very excited. Back in the hab, the first microbiology samples were put on petri dishes to be cultivated in the incubator.The EVA 2 team went up towards North Ridge taking also small samples to be tested if bacteria can be grown.Tonight we are having Mexican wraps and sport session with HSO R.

The morning ritual of sky-gazing and sipping coffee will remain a cherished memory of Mars. The Crew was treated to a pancake breakfast by Crew Engineer Wise. Following the meal, Commander Hanacek delegated Crew members to station clean up – MDRS lower deck, upper deck, airlocks and stair, the RAM, and the Science Dome. We were fortunate that MAU Crew Engineer Roberts cleaned Spirit and Curiosity rovers – scrubbing off the red mud by hand. We really appreciated that he took this on knowing he had to depart for Earth later that day. The MAU Crew was joined by a few of the MDRS Crew members for the better part of the afternoon to take down the MAU Station which is a series of portable structures – airlock, living quarters, crew activity / meal, and cooking area. Due to cycles of Mars soil freezing and thawing, the station required a great deal of regular maintenance and engineering support. We are grateful we are resourceful! Marufa Bhuiyan, MSc. and International Astrology Researcher joined me in cleaning the upper deck. The arrival of a beautiful new gas stove was a highlight for me as I was preparing to make pizza with the herbs form the Green Hab for a late lunch. As part of a multi-tasking habit from Earth, I let lunch preparation sit and accompanied the MDRS Assistant Director on the check-out walk through. I am pleased to report that the Station is ship shape. The rest of the afternoon was focused on packing up the MAU station into the UHaul, writing reports and completing science research studies.Look Ahead Plan: This evening activities includes finishing reports, briefing the incoming crew and going to town for shared meal.

crew 220 - 31/01/2020," The MDRS-MAU crews woke up at 07:00 on this beautiful red planet – Mars. Captivated by its timelessness, we confirmed this was indeed a real “time” through using our precious radios located at both stations. About time and space – we understand that time passes at different rate for different people and we need space for ourselves. No wonder we needed a reality check – it was a breathtaking view outside on Mars. Let us not forget to have a quick glance (about sky, land and weather) as we did here on Mars, watching through Mars unfolding though the unique round-shaped kitchen windows in the Hab. No humans (or animals) were running around outside; I could not spot anyone! The crew had some brief but intensive conversations in the short span of our quick regular breakfast together. Today’s topics included: culture, science, world politics, religion, human behavior to name a few. Since we had a pre-scheduled join MAU-MDRS Medical EVA (MEVA) at 09:00 we finished our breakfast really quick and postponed our precious conversations for the next round.Building on lessons from yesterday’s MEVA, MDRS crew members felt mentally organized and capable of implementing what they learned in Mars which to humans is an austere environment. MDRS MEVA crews drove the rovers (e.g. Curiosity and Spirit) from MDRS Habitat to Mars Academy USA (MAU) Station which took only a few minutes. We were confident about starting our journey to MAU station because we had a professional doctor (Dr. Johannes Svensoy, MD), an efficient videographer who is also the Commander for MDRS (John Hanacek) and two talented crew members (Connie Delisle, PhD and Marufa Bhuiyan, MSc.) from different parts of the planet Earth. As soon as we reached MAU station, we were cordially greeted and well received by two sophisticated MAU crews (Matt Wise and Lee Roberts, MSc.) from the MAU station. Commander Hanacek did a great job in setting up the plot for injury site (simulated injured astronaut) in a proper location (GPS Coordinate: 12518124, 4250680) while we were waiting for other two crew members (Wise and Roberts) to return from MDRS to fetch radios we determined we needed. The combined team (both MDRS and MAU crews) proceeded to execute a Search and Rescue (SAR) and quickly located the injury site. They two attending medical professionals (Wise and Svensoy) executed the initial medical assessment (P-MARCH-P) protocol. Since all injuries on Mars are deemed as major, we called for METHANE and injured astronaut (simulated/dummy) was transported in the “Golden Bubble” – a pressurized medivac device prototype invented by Crew member Wise. As soon as both rovers arrived at the MDRS station, we had another simulated incident near at the corner of the GreenHab – simulating the rover running over crew astronaut Marufa Bhuiyan’s (who tries to be a human) right foot. Immediately two Crew astronauts helped the injured astronaut, the medical professionals also took great care to assess the condition.The MEVA ended successfully today; by that I mean we will learn from our errors and take to heart the things we did efficiently. An exciting achievement was in getting the drone in the air and taking Arial shots of the MEVA.Just after the lunch, the GreenHab Officer went to our amazing green-looking spaceship we call “GreenHab” to put some labels, setting up recycle bins, and cleaning/sweeping the Hab for the next crews. We request MDRS to replace these labels with permanent labels or, re-label these newly planted seeds (e.g. Ginger brought by our crew member Matt Wise, Romania Lettuce, Radish Sparkle, Bell Pepper (California Wonder) and re-arranged a mystery seed; no one knows what plant it is, probably a surprise for the next MDRS crews. In addition, we added a new red handled paint brush (to clean dust), seed bank (not labelled yet), hand sanitizer, napkins, and labelled two recycle bins/tubs (organic and inorganic/non burn) for the future crews.Look Ahead Plan: Sol 13. Today marks the close of the MEVAs.

crew 220 - 31/01/2020," Today is our last Sol at MAU station, and we made the most of it! The Sol started with MAU Station hosting MDRS Engineer Wise as its Ambassador, yielding a fruitful and productive exchange regarding mission and engineering operations and logistics. Next, both MAU and MDRS stations conducted a a joint medical EVA exercise which tested the EVA team’s search-and-rescue, medical assessment and evacuation capabilities. The team shone and performed admirably amidst a complex situation! The afternoon was rounded out with check out cleaning, inventorying, report-writing and wrap-up activities, leaving the evening free for the crew to enjoy each other’s company one last time amidst art and Indian food.

crew 220 - 30/01/2020," The Crew rose at 07:00 to an intensive skyscape. The orange glow of the forever red dunes of Mars is a sight to always remember. After a light breakfast, the MDRS Crew began preparations for the morning Medical EVA (MEVA), starting with a rendezvous at the MAU station. Each station fielded its own team, meeting at MAU station to commence the MEVA. The Crews successfully met most of the MEVA objectives set by Commander Hanacek; namely to integrate medical assessment and Search and Rescue techniques and tools. Medical techniques drilled in previous MEVAs include: P-MARCH-P for primary trauma survey, Secondary Survey, and SAMPLE. The Golden Bubble and a semi-autonomous drone was slated for testing for the first time in the Mission with a view to obtaining comparative data concerning the challenges in rescue and medical assessments in ICE environments.XO Wise remained at MDRS to allow time to focus solely on setting up a test MAU-MDRS WIFI connection which is part of the objectives set for this mission. Should connectivity be established it would represent another piece of the MAU Crew Lead’s vision clicking into place.Look Ahead Plan: Sol 12. Additional training will be conducted tomorrow, in order to reinforce the medical and Search and Rescue (SAR) already delivered. In addition, a second attempt will be made to test the drone. The main objectives are to add this capability, test it, as well as drill and become more fluent with what has already been learned. The Crew will be asked to take mental note of the challenges in applying these well establish techniques in ICE conditions. This information can be fed back to the organizations and innovators that are designing technology and procedures for ICE environments.We continue to receive top quality advice and guidance from CapComms and we really appreciate the kind comments and interest showed. As a final word, it was a pleasure and honor to Command MDRS; at the same time I was delighted to welcome back Commander Hanaceck to take command of MDRS late last night. I continue working with him to assure he is fully supported and up to speed as the overall Mission is quickly coming into its final few days.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Tonight’s low to -2 degrees (Celsius).

crew 220 - 30/01/2020," As our Mission winds down, we are working together to coordinate the final touches on our projects, studies, technology demonstrations and academic activities. The morning at MAU started with a team breakfast as we hosted our second-ever MDRS ambassador, MDRS GreenHab Officer Bhuiyan, whose presence delighted us all, and who herself seemed to enjoy the visit. Next, the MAU and MDRS teams united to conduct a joint search-and-rescue, triage and evacuation exercise that tested the skills the two crews had learned this mission. The day continued with expert-led knowledge transfers and demonstrations as various crew members led demonstrations of virtual reality, ultrasound and medical technologies. The evening will end with some medical teaching regarding airway management, as well as arts and wellness actvitities, including a Mars Circle.Look Ahead Plan: As our Mission winds down, we will be filling the final Sol with one last advanced medical drill involving search-and-rescue, triage and evacuation, and some final wellness, arts and teaching activities.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: -6C low / 5C max, 0C average.Crew Physical Status: MAU-velous, dahlingEVA: Successful search-and-rescue, medical triage and evacuation mission accomplished today.Reports to be filed:Sol SummaryCommander’s ReportPhoto ReportOperations ReportEVA ReportEVA Request: Pending."
crew 220 - 29/01/2020," We had an extremely productive day at MAU. The morning consisted of in-depth upkeep, cleaning, and maintenance, and we achieved a lot in getting our electrical operations, data network and station cleanliness up to par. In other news, we hosted our first-ever visiting Ambassador from MDRS, Officer Kainu, and deem our first exchange extremely successful, and look forward to many more. The afternoon saw a successful exploratory EVA to Cowboy’s Corner with the MAU Crew, followed by an evening sojourn to MDRS for a cultural exchange including martial arts and dance demonstrations, and culminating with a ""Future Cafe.""Look Ahead Plan: As our Mission winds down, we will be filling the remaining Sols with medical technology demonstrations, academic activities, wellness and a few more EVAs.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: -6C low / 5C max, 0C average.Crew Physical Status: MAUminalEVA: Successful Exploratory EVA to Cowboy’s Corner completed.Reports to be filed:Sol SummaryCommander’s ReportPhoto ReportOperations ReportEVA ReportEVA Request: Pending."
crew 220 - 29/01/2020," The Crew rose at 08:00 to a cloudy sky with very light snow. Into mid-morning Mother Nature decided to bless us with high cloud and sun. MDRS again served as a relay point to MAU to communicate with the MAU Director. However, XO Wise has made good progress today in setting up a test WIFI connection which is part of the objectives set during this mission. The remaining Crew at MDRS, myself and astronomy researcher Marufa Akhter Bhuiyan thoroughly cleaned and organized the lower deck – floor, walls, airlocks, bathroom, cabinets. A safe, orderly homebase not only helps avoid accidents – it creates a sense of ownership and in becoming a home we could be forever living here on Mars if we didn’t have to return to Earth.The MDRS Crew stayed close to home today to work in the GreenHab, planting radishes and romain lettuce. MDRS also served as HabComm to support the MAU Crew who participated in a 3-hour EVA focused on exploration and scouting. From a Raven’s eye view, the Team Leader remarked that “he felt part of the landscape of Mars”. The rolling red hills and blue sky was a remarkable backdrop to explore the soil, rocks and outcroppings.Look Ahead Plan: Sol 11 includes an AM and PM EVA. These experiences aim to reinforce the medical training already received and introduce Search and Rescue (SAR). On Mars, medical emergencies may occur in the Hab or on EVA. The MAU-MDRS Crew testing and training is fundamental to establish a baseline understanding of the medical challenges in using “Earth” patient assessment protocols, conventional SAR equipment and applying operational protocols for recovery. All this hard work is for the purpose of innovating medical equipment, training and processes to improve the safety of security of astronauts on Mars.Yesterday was a milestone in submitting reports before the CapComm window closure yesterday and to receive such positive comments on the photos. The Crew has done a great job on progressively becoming more organized, creating time and space to spend time on reports, science and to reflect on life on MARS. As this is my last night as Commander at MDRS, I am happy to transfer to Commander Hanacek, a station that I feel is well taken care of and appreciated.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Approximately -6C at night, max 3C during the day tomorrow; probability of precipitation is less than 20%.Crew Physical Status: All the Crew is good health, bolstered after a good night’s sleep.EVA: One morning and one in the afternoon.Reports to be filed:Journalist ReportSol SummaryPhoto ReportOperations ReportGreenHab Report"

HabComm and one other Crew member manned the Station while the remainder of the team participated in a 3-hour geological EVA (gEVA). Yet another first for the Crew, they eagerly learned about the procedure for soil sampling and analysis.Look Ahead Plan: Sol 10 includes work at MDRS. Since the Crew is only three for the bulk of the day, we will remain at the station. We will commence with work in the GreenHab including soil pH testing, planting and harvesting. This will be followed by catching up on social science (behavior motivation to go to Mars), and nutrition studies. A researcher and I will commence drafting of a paper on the GreenHab operations, comparing ICE to non-ICE environments. I will provide the paper to MDRS and MAU directors for their decision to keep for internal information or to at any point ahead to share for external publication.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Approximately -4C at night, max 5C during day until Saturday, minimal chance of precipitation (20%).Crew Physical Status: Commanders and Crew put in really full day of work with a longer EVA than usual, followed by a nearly 3-hour science lab to do the soil analysis.

crew 220 - 27/01/2020,"The day started with a joint briefing and breakfast between the MAU and MDRS Crew. Today’s morning activities were designed to help the Crew put the medical training on three assessment techniques: P-MARCH-P, Secondary Site Survey and SAMPLE procedure. Crew members assessed the condition of simulated victims, and for the first time, used XO Wise’s “Golden Bubble”. The point clearly hit home – that there are many different challenges in assessing, recovering and transporting a patient on Mars.Look Ahead Plan: Sol 9 includes another first on this Mission, a Geological EVA. First, the Crew will be briefed on soil collection procedures by Crew Member and Researcher, Morgan Kainu. Second, the Crew will attend the Science Dome to partake in soil sampling research. This includes testing soil textures and other properties along with using a black light.Anomalies in work: The weather report did not indicate the warmth of the sun and had to redo the compression/decompression sequence at MDRS to take off cold weather clothing. Also, the wind between 011:00 and 17:00 was markedly higher than previous days, with gust estimated at 25 MPH. The Crew adapted by securing their equipment and also doing two rendezvous at MAU station. Some remedial work was needed there to ensure that the equipment was secured.Weather: Tonight, clear skies with a lowest temperature later this evening around -6°C, with a 0% chance of snow. The average highest temperature during the day is expected to reach 5°C.Crew Physical Status: Commanders and Crew worked very hard today – both mentally and physically.

crew 220 - 27/01/2020," The MAU and MDRS rendezvoused for a day of medical drilling, skilling and practical application. In the morning, the two physicians on the crew reviewed previously learned skills, and then also taught the crew about additional triage and assessment skills. These skills were then tested in simulated trauma scenarios on EVA in front of the hab. Most excitingly, these EVAs saw the first deployment of the Golden Bubble pressurized transport device in the field, which was successful, and provided many useful data points going forward. In other news, it was a windy day on Mars, necessitating two Engineering EVAs at MAU station to safely secure the base against the elements.Look Ahead Plan: The crew looks forward to a day full of geological science and exploration tomorrow!Weather: -6C low tonight with light winds at 12kph / 0% chance of precipitation tonight & tomorrowCrew Physical Status: MEDucatedEVA: AM & PM medical EVAs drilling trauma scenarios in front of the MDRS HabReports to be filed:Sol Summary (sent)Commander's Report (sent)EVA ReportOperations ReportGreenHab ReportPhoto ReportScience ReportEVA Request: Pending."

Thesun shone brightly and everyone’s mood was light and jovial, as crewmembers busied themselves and joked amongst one another. H. Blackburnprepared tuna tacos for lunch, to the great enjoyment of everyonepresent, and then the EVA support team went downstairs to preparesuits for EVA #14’s 1300 departure. Checklists were followed, and EVA#14 exited the airlock a minute early. They returned an hour and ahalf later with a bag full of samples, and the much of the crew spentthe afternoon in the science dome investigating and cataloging the newscientific material, while K. Crisman collected his biometric datafrom the EVA’s participants. The crew then sat down and wrote theirevening’s reports while H. Blackburn effortlessly whipped up adelicious chicken pot pie...of which there were no leftovers. AfterComms window, the team will meet one more time to discuss tomorrow’splan before bedding down for another full day on Mars.

Excitement for the future of this new and excellent program and organizing and cleaning the hab for the crew departure.Sol Activity Summary: As the mission was beginning to end, there was only one more thing we needed to do: launch some rocket! During an hour and a half, we built, designed and put together our missiles, some of us more gracefully than others. After a harsh hour fighting with our crafts abilities (yes, S, I mean you), we had to wait for the magic glue to dry. In the meantime, part of the crew proceeded to perform our morning EVA to Hab Ridge to collect devil's toenail, seashells from the Jurassic. We organize and plant several new seeds in the GreenHab, we created miniature environments in our terrarium, made of Mars simulant soil, and planted the cutest succulents in the world (my little baby is called Piko). The rocket launching during our last EVA was something I'll never forget, Jenn and Shannon had a successful launch and recovery, while Teresa and I will keep trying. An amazing day on an amazing mission with an amazing crew.Look Ahead Plan: Crew 217 is taking off and going back to Mars! Well, part of it, the two regular Martians will stay holding the base. The crew will be departing on different hours and by noon the Hab will have a week-off.Anomalies in work: Nothing to report.Weather: Warm during most of the day, partly clear skies, almost none winds.Crew Physical Status: Tired, healthy, and accomplished.EVA: The last two EVAs of the mission.

crew 217 - 11/12/2019," Second day on the red planet and rocking our mission goals.Sol Activity Summary: We started the day earlier, as we needed to cover a considerable amount of activities. The morning began with a double breakfast on my side and our first Biology class from our favorite Ecology teacher, Shannon Ruppert. The main objective of the day was to get 3 types of biology samples: gypsum from the Moon areas, water from pre-selected ponds and some fragments from the mysterious unidentified green layer. All of them were collected wonderfully. We aimed to plated them on agar so we would be able to determine qualitatively the biological content of them. In order to do that, we MacGyvered the agar making business and created (patent pending) the ""Petry baggies"". Today has been a wonderful day, I saw Shannon put a suit and go on an EVA for the first time ever, and you don't usually see that. I haven't been in sim for a while, but spending this week with wonderful people, one more inspiring and dedicated than the next one, it's really fulfilling. I haven't been in school for a long long time, but if I had one of these teachers for just a day when I was growing up, I would have definitely changed my life. Looking forward to seeing their work and how this experience will create new and better programs for their kids.Look Ahead Plan: Last day of the mission! We will start preparing the rockets for our afternoon EVA. Part of the crew will be doing the first last EVA to Hab Ridge during the morning. After lunch, we will be working on the GreenHab, planting and making a terrarium with Mars soil simulant. During the afternoon, small rockets wait for us to be launch And during the evening, we will try to wrap up the mission and spend our last night together.Anomalies in work: Nothing to report.Weather: Colder than yesterday, partly clear skies, light winds, and an impressive full moon.Crew Physical Status: Healthy, a little bit tired, but happy.EVA: Our first two long EVAs tackling our scientific goals: water holes, gypsum, and unidentified green layer sample return.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary, EVA Reports 3 & 4, EVA Request, GreenHab Report, Science Report, Operations Report, Journalist Report, and Photos."

We awoke to our first Martian day and made the most of it.Sol Activity Summary: We spent the morning sharing our teaching experiences and activities, and at one point while I was smashing #10 cans on the upper deck, the crew was busy downstairs creating a habitat out of cups, plates, straws, file folders and recycled plastic containers. I was reminded of that Apollo 13 scene where they dump everything on the table to create a solution for the scrubber problem (“Failure is not an option”). After lunch, we trained in suits and rovers while taking our first short EVAs to the Marble Ritual. Everyone was super excited about wearing the suits and being outside. Then we settled down to a wonderful Taco Tuesday dinner with homemade tortillas and space ball taco meat. We created our work plan for tomorrow, then decided to spend the rest of the evening doing COMMS and relaxing. It’s been a wonderful but busy day.Look Ahead Plan: We will spend the morning in the lab making plates for our halophile experiment. Then part of the crew will go on an EVA to Lith Canyon to collect pothole water samples for analysis and they will also collect samples from a green layer in the stratigraphy here and we will plate them to see what is living there. Finally, a second EVA will go to The Moons to collect gypsum samples to plate.Anomalies in work: Atila and I needed to go to town for supplies and that set us back a couple of hours so that is why we pushed the plate making back until morning. It’s hard to create a Martian pace with only three days to do so much, but I am trying.Weather: Sunny and very warm for this time of yearCrew Physical Status: Happy, healthy, some of us are clean, all of us will sleep well.EVA: Two short training EVAs to the Marble Ritual, XO lead both of them.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report.

crew 215 - 21/11/2019," More overnight rain continued to leave the environs impassable but a strong wind in the early morning had things drying out. After the morning brief, more seedlings and seeds were planted in the Green Hab and, in the Science Dome, the making of gypsum tiles continued. The final tiles were completed in the afternoon and have been left out to dry. Just after lunch, the final emergency simulation was carried when a checklist-supported response was initiated for an injured crew member within the hab. It was successfully carried out and evaluated. Meanwhile, another test of the gypsum powder was devised when a small splint was manufactured and applied to a simulated broken index finger. Though it was applied before being fully set, the gypsum splint proved successful in immobilizing the finger for 2 hours before it was removed. A further 1.5ml of water was collected for testing as a basis for medical grade solutions. Dinner tonight was tortilla soup with fresh bread followed by chocolate pudding with jelly, fruit salad and peanut butter cookies.Look Ahead Plan: Cleaning of staterooms and living areas, inventorying food and equipment and cleaning of the Science, Green Hab and RAM areas in preparation for end of rotation handover.

crew 213 - 10/06/2019,"Last night was not the greatest for observing, so some of us were sporadically sleeping in hopes of getting good images. Becker got some gorgeous shots of the moon, but that was the extent of the night. It was too cloudy for anything else.Thomas left early this morning and for the rest of us, our last day was a clean-up / maintenance day. Armstrong and I got one last use in of the solar scope to test it and got our images processed. Later in the day, while Armstrong helped Detterline with getting dirt and a flagstone stair around the Musk Observatory, I was helping Becker with breaking down his telescope and getting gear into the Jeep for tomorrow. Becker also got the images of the propane tank processed and sent out and Detterline also continued work on the video project.Today was also Becker’s birthday, so we celebrated a bit. We took a trip to the local rock shop before having dinner and heading out to Goblin National Park.Tonight, there will be two different imaging cycles. Armstrong and Becker will be heading out earlier this evening to image with the moon. Detterline will be heading out early in the morning to image without the moon. I personally don’t know what I’m going to do yet. I might go to bed early so I can be up early and get my last few things packed up and squared away.We leave Mars tomorrow morning at hopefully 10 am at the latest. Since this is my last entry for this crew, I want to say ‘thank you’ to everyone who has joined us here, both as crew and guest. If it weren’t for all of you, this trip would not have been as successful as it was. Becker and Detterline, thank you for giving me this amazing opportunity.

crew 213 - 09/06/2019,"Last night’s star party went off without a hitch, although a bit cold. Once the moon was behind the hills, the stars covered the skies. It was so nice to share this love of space and the stars with others. Made being out in the cold and wind worth it. Detterline and Thomas stayed out for longer and took a single image of the Dumbbell Nebulae with the Robotic Observatory that lasted 10 minutes. Thomas wanted to see what the tracking was like to check the quality of the mount. The attached picture is gorgeous. If the weather cooperates with us, they want to try it again tonight for 15 and 20 minutes.Today was a sort of maintenance day. We got the crack through the Musk Observatory filled, as well as a crack forming on the back-airlock porch. Detterline and Thomas took the desiccant out of the telescope cameras and baked them at 240? F for 2 hours to re-energize the material. This will be part of the maintenance routine from here on out.Thomas also got some work done in the RoboticObservatory today. He discussed some new telescope routines including a new park position for the telescope, and the rationale for why the telescope needs a 30? cut off rather than a 20? one, which is what Detterline was hoping for. This means that you can’t image anything lower than 30?.Armstrong, Becker, Thomas, and I also took a short trip to the local dinosaur dig while Detterline worked on the training video. While it was technically closed today, they were still kind enough to give us a quick look around. It was nice to see what was going on in what is sort of our own backyard. We got to see a clump of large bones they had been working on and may soon be moving off to their museum.Today was not perfect, though. The internet has been going in and out all day, which makes our work more difficult. Detterline and Thomas also tried to get the video cameras working, but with no luck. They are still working on it, but with Thomas leaving tomorrow and the rest of us leaving Tuesday morning, we aren’t sure if we’ll be able to get them operational.Accomplished:Poured concrete in cracks in Musk and Hab10 minute exposure of Dumbbell NebulaDetterline finished recording training videos for the Musk ObservatoryDesiccant was dried outPower:Soc = 87%Problems:Internet going in and out all dayCould not get cameras operationalPictures:Pictures 1, 2, and 3 are taken by Peyton Zankel.

crew 213 - 08/06/2019,"Last night was too cloudy to do any observing and this evening has brought wind.Today, we had a rather busy day. This morning, we prepared the Musk Observatory for concrete by removing the caulking we just put in. That was a chore and a half to do since it wasn’t even fully set yet. During this, we also got to play host to a local singer Rod, whom we had the chance of meeting yesterday at dinner. We gave him a tour of the Hab and its surrounding buildings, as well as showing him the capabilities of the solar scope. Armstrong and I got an image of the sun processed during this time to show him how we process. This was great practice for us and helped Detterline with perfecting his new manual.Armstrong, Detterline, and I went to Green River today to make sure we had the right concrete for the Musk. During this, Becker stayed behind to work on taking pictures for the VR project. Also, while we were gone, Scott and Eric arrived to pick up the spacesuits, and Thomas worked on the robotic observatory.Detterline also finished up the video for solar imaging and we also started work on installing video cameras around the site.Tonight will be a bit of a star party, so long as the weather holds. Scott, Eric, and Rod will be joining us tonight to observe the stars and potentially use the scope we have set up. While the sky is clear, the wind is starting to blow. Hopefully we do not have to cut our night short like last night.Accomplished:Solar Imaging and processingVideo made of solar imagingPulled grout out of the crack in the Musk ObservatoryEd worked in the Robotic Observatory with the 10 Micron mount.

The solar telescope was replaced with a Celestron 8? so an alignment procedure could be done at night with the stars. The last time the Musk Observatory was used at night was over 2 years ago. The hand controls were tested in the morning by Detterline, and the alignment for both are perfect.They also went to the Robotic telescope and centered the focus for the Celestron 14? The night was too cloudy for any observing.An impressive rain storm dumped a lot of water in a short period of time accompanied by lightning and thunder. Detterline is proud to say that after the storm, the interior of the Musk Observatory and the MDRS Robotic Observatory were perfectly dry. So the new caulking applied just days ago, worked well. Last year they had an issue where water seeped inside the Robotic Observatory and destroyed an adapter component of the weather station.Today was the most boring day on Mars. Due to high winds, there was pretty much nothing we could do. Armstrong continued to perfect his processing skills, Detterline left with Thomas to go get concrete to fix the pad for the Musk, and Detterline also worked on the training videos.We went out for dinner and enjoyed some live music. It’s always nice to get a little break from Hab life. Tomorrow should be more exciting due to a few visitors coming in and a clear night. Tonight though, we will have another early night due to cloudy skies. They should clear between 12-3 am, so maybe we might have some images to process tomorrow. Hopefully, we wake up early enough to make ourselves human before our guests arrive.Accomplished:We decided to get concrete mix rather than caulk due to the size of the crack and try to make something a bit more permanent. A trip to Green River secured the supplies needed, but the horrendous winds won’t allow an observatory to open and certainly not allow opening a bag of concrete mix.The Musk Solar Observatory Guide is now complete and on the MDRS Observatories Training site, and Astronomy Laptop. Also on the laptop are the first of a series of training videos. The MDRS Observatories training website is updated, but video links will be added once Detterline returns home.Power:Soc = 96%Problems:Got the concrete, but it was too windy to use it.Pictures:Picture 1 was provided by Peter Detterline of Ed Thomas working in the Solar Observatory last night"
crew 213 - 06/06/2019,"Today got off to a late start at the Hab today. We were out most of the night enjoying the clear, star-filled skies while we had the chance to. Armstrong got his start in astrophotography and I got to knock the rust off my hand-controller skills. It was absolutely stunning.When we finally got started for the day, Detterline gave Armstrong and me a lesson on image processing. I processed my first colored image using my shots of the Leo Trio taken from the robotic observatory. It was certainly an experience, that’s for sure. Armstrong already had an idea of what to do, so when I left with Becker and Detterline to help clean the solar observatory, he stayed behind to work on making the process to produce cleaner images.The solar observatory was in need of some maintenance. The crack in the concrete slab has widened considerably since last year. We did not have enough caulk to completely fill the crack. We will need to buy more concrete caulk and we need to get stone for the outside of the building to replace what has eroded away. Other than that, the rest was basic maintenance. The dome rail was cleaned and so was the scope and the rest of the observatory got a good wipe down.Ed Thomas has also joined us today. He is the owner of Deep Space Products and the individual responsible for selection and installation of the key components of the robotic observatory. Thomas will be looking over the system in the next few days and working to solve some minor issues.Due to earlier rain, we are not completely sure about how tonight will go for observing. We always hope for clear, beautiful skies, but it could just as well be an early night if the clouds do not cooperate with us.Accomplished:Musk Observatory· cleaned walls, floor, mount, optics, and made some minor fixes,· tested and calibrated the hand control and its spare.· solar imagingTraining VideosCole solved some sound problems so we can start making training videos for the crews on using the telescopes and processing techniques.Power:Soc = 90% @ 21:00Problems:The focus problem with the MDRS-WF is solved. Although some of the camera screws were too loose and the camera turned during one exposure. Easy fix. Ed will double check it tomorrow.Crack in Musk Observatory concrete. Looking into using quickrete to fill in the crack rather than caulk, but stone will still be needed outside around the concrete, preferably before winter returns. If the crack continues to widen, the building will become out of round and the dome will not be able to rotate. We’ve already noticed some scraping of the wheels as it rotates.Pictures:Picture 1 was taken by Peter Detterline of Peyton Zankel and Gary Becker cleaning the Musk Observatory. Picture 2 is also provided by Peter Detterline of the group of us exploring the night sky last night. Picture 3 is of Peyton’s first attempt at color imaging: the Leo Trio. Picture 4 is Detterline caulking the concrete crack in the Musk Observtaory. This is an image taken by Gary A. Becker. Gary also took the image of Detterline next to the dirty telescope corrector plate at the Robotic Observatory. Yes, it’s very clean now!																																																														"
crew 213 - 05/06/2019," Soc = 88% at 22:40 We will keep tabs and turn the generator on if it reaches 75%.After last night’s observing, today became a new day of work. Last night’s observations through the robotic telescope produced some great images, but there was a focus issue and a mount error during the night.This morning, Armstrong and I took the time to practice more with the solar scope and go through the steps of processing what we found. It was definitely a more successful day since now we had more of an idea of what to do. While we were doing our work, Becker and Detterline were working on theirs; maintaining the robotic observatory. The optics and equipment were cleaned, the seams were caulked, and the walls and floor got a good wipe down. Tomorrow, the solar observatory will get the same treatment.This evening we took a trip to Capitol Reef to get our minds off Mars for a while and go see the petroglyphs. Many laughs were had there and over dinner at a nearby restaurant. We returned at about 22:45. Tonight we have another night of observation, and the sky is so clear. It will be perfect for watching the night sky with both the naked eye and hopefully the robotic observatory. So far, she is cooperating with us, and we hope she will continue to. If not, at least we have a pretty view.Accomplished:Zankel and Armstrong used the Solar ObservatoryBecker and Detterline cleaned Robotic ObservatoryCleaned opticsCleaned equipmentCaulked seamsWiped down walls and floorsProblems: Focus issue with the MDRS-WF. Detterline will be working with that tonight, and is confident it will be fixed quickly.Pictures:First and third pictures provided by Peter Detterline.

crew 213 - 04/06/2019," Slower day at the Hab. Armstrong and I took a brief hike around the site before learning how to use the Musk Observatory. We went in alone so that the new user manual could be tested and we could each get a feel for it. Becker and Detterline worked on other projects today. Becker and Armstrong set up a new Bloomsky camera, and set up Becker’s telescope. Detterline and Jones fixed the weather station and replaced the batteries in the robotic observatory. Detterline also organized the robotic observatory.Accomplished:Zankel and Armstrong took and processed their first solar images.

crew 211 - 02/05/2019," The commander and vice-commander began the day with a nice morning EVA along the Hab Ridge Road. After the breakfast, the commander and vice-commander deployed their respective experiment during an engineering EVA while the rest of the team finalized their own experiments. The deployment was postponed to this morning as different minor bugs prevented us to do it yesterday evening.The GreenHab officer harvested the Spirulina that was growing since more than a week and started to dry it. Part of the crew left at 5 pm for an EVA to Grey Moon. Tonight we will all observe the stars, enjoying the clear sky that the Utah offers.Look Ahead Plan: We planned two EVAs for tomorrow as it is our last day on Mars.Part of the crew will go to North Ridge in the morning. The rest of the team will end their experiment and start writing the summary report. We will get back the antennas and the cubelanders, in the morning during an engineering EVA. In the afternoon, we will do a second EVA, again to North Ridge. The rest of the afternoon will be devoted to packing our cases.Anomalies in work: No issues.Weather: Sunny, almost no windCrew Physical Status: GoodEVA: The morning EVA along Hab Ridge Road was shortened by the presence of steam in our helmets due to the low temperature at this time of the day.

The EVA team saw breathtaking panoramas.Reports to be filed: Journalist Report, GreenHab Report, Operations Report, Science Report, EVA Request, EVA Report, Daily Photo Report"
crew 211 - 01/05/2019," After a difficult night with the storm and a temperature drop of more than 10 °c, we made some nice pancakes to comfort us. We then all worked on our experiments as the morning EVA was postponed to the early afternoon to wait for the mud to dry. Half of the crew made an EVA to Kissing Camel from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm. The rest of the crew left at 4:30 pm for another EVA to Condor Chasma. The objective of the first EVA was to gather information about potential places to set-up a temporary antennas system for geolocation and information transmission. This will be one of the projects for the next UCL to Mars crew for the season 2019-2020. We end the day by deploying the antenna of the vice-commander experiment and the cubelanders of the commander experiments.Look Ahead Plan: We plan to do another EVA as the end of the stays is approaching. We will get back the antennas and the cubelanders, in the morning, before walking north following the path 1103 to the sinkhole near Hab ridge road. A second EVA is planned in the afternoon to Grey Moon. We will also try to finalize our respective experiments in order to be able to write the final report for Friday night.Anomalies in work: No issues.Weather: Mostly sunny, almost no windCrew Physical Status: GoodEVA: We had two EVAs today to enjoy the nice weather after two days of showers. The EVA to Kissing Camel allowed us to prospect for good places to setup antennas to possibly create communication and geolocation systems in order to improve the communication between the Hab and EVA teams.Reports to be filed: Journalist Report, GreenHab Report, Operations Report, Science Report, EVA Request, EVA Report, Daily Photo Report"
crew 211 - 30/04/2019," As we had numerous showers during the night, the morning EVA was unfortunately postponed to the afternoon and then cancelled as the weather deteriorated in the afternoon. We therefore worked all day on our experiments. We had an interesting meeting after the lunch to discuss with the crew journalist some articles of our Martian constitution. The experiment of the Commander and the Vice-Commander are now almost ready for field experiment.Look Ahead Plan: Depending on the weather, we will try again to do a morning EVA to Kissing Camel and an afternoon EVA to Candor Chasma, as the end of our stay is approaching. We will in parallel work on our respective experiments and hopefully be able to start in the afternoon the field experiments with the cubelanders and the geolocation antennas.Anomalies in work: No issues.Weather: Showers, mostly cloudy and very windyCrew Physical Status: GoodEVA: The EVA has been cancelled due to bad weather.Reports to be filed: Journalist Report, GreenHab Report, Operations Report, Science Report, EVA Request, Daily Photo Report"
crew 211 - 29/04/2019," After a quick breakfast, the commander welcomed the PBS team in spacesuit outside of the Hab. We then made a tour of the MDRS campus with the TV crew, each member of the UCL to Mars team presenting part of the infrastructures and discussing his/her experiment. Half of the crew left then for an EVA with Liz Adeola to Cow Dung Road between the Robert’s Rock Garden and Zurbin’s head. The EVA team got back at noon and we all had a nice lunch together. The crew commander and the crew astronomer were then interviewed for about one hour. All the crew members went then back to work once the TV crew left the campus.Look Ahead Plan: Depending on the weather, we plan to start the day with an EVA to Kissing Camel. We will then work on our respective experiments for the rest of the day preparing the first experiment related EVA for the commander and vice-commander which should be organized on Wednesday.Anomalies in work: No issues.Weather: Showers, mostly cloudy and windyCrew Physical Status: GoodEVA: Half of the crew explored the west part of Cow Dung Road with the PBS crew.

crew 211 - 27/04/2019," After three attempts, we finally had a successful EVA to Special Region. The rovers worked nominally and we spent one hour in Special region to explore the surrounding and try to find traces of ancient Martian life. Unfortunately, we didn’t find any traces of microbial or more evolved life. After a nice lunch, we all returned to our experiments until the CapCom.Look Ahead Plan: An EVA is planned in the morning to go to White Rock Canyon on the 1101 and then go back to Cow Dung Road between the Robert’s Rock Garden and Zubrin’s head. We have been there for the first EVA and members of the crew would like to go back to get more soil samples. Half of the crew will stay at the base to work on their experiments. The rest of the day will be devoted to these experiments.Anomalies in work: No issues.Weather: Sunny in the morning and partly cloudy and windy in the afternoon.Crew Physical Status: GoodEVA: Half of the crew managed to get to the Special region for a very nice EVA. After a one hour walk, we didn’t find any trace of ancient Martian life. However, we found a cavity which could be the entrance of a larger underground structure which may provide shelter to the crew. The cavity was not large enough to consider the possibility of creating an underground facility.Reports to be filed: Journalist Report, GreenHab Report, HSO report, Science Report, Operations Report, EVA report, EVA Request, Daily Photo Report"
crew 211 - 25/04/2019," The day started with an EVA to explore the Special Region. Unfortunately the battery level of the Spirit rover decreased to fast so we couldn’t reach the Special region. After a short briefing with the Hab, we decided to explore instead the Galileo road 1104 for about 30 minutes. We then worked on our experiments until the lunch. After a nice lunch altogether, the HSO performed a quick check-up on the crew member who twisted his ankle three days ago. As the ankle was still pretty much swelled, we decided with Dr Rupert that it would be better to see a doctor. We therefore drove the crew car to the Bicknell Health Care center. Fortunately, the ankle was not broken and the crew member should be healed within a week. The rest of the team worked during the afternoon on their respective experiments.Look Ahead Plan: An EVA is planned in the morning to explore Special Region. Half of the crew will stay at the base to work, as usual, on their experiments. The rest of the day will be devoted to these experiments.Anomalies in work: No issues.Weather: Hot, bright and sunny most of the day, but windy in the evening.Crew Physical Status: Twisted ankle still bloated but should be healed within a weekEVA: The aim of today’s EVA was to explore the Special Region.

crew 211 - 24/04/2019," After the daily medical check-up and a nice breakfast with chocolate pancakes, members of the crew left at 9:00 am for an EVA to get back Opportunity still stuck near Candor Chasma. To avoid any other issues with the rover, the EVA team got directly back to the Hab and continued its EVA on foot to explore the hills surrounding the base. The surprise of today came at 10:15 am when we learned that the student visit scheduled for tomorrow would in fact start 15 minutes later. We spent the next four hours with two groups of students visiting the different infrastructures of the MDRS and presenting our research works. These four hours have been very enriching for both the students and the UCL to Mars team. After the lunch, we all worked on our experiments. Tonight will be dedicated to sky observations with the remote controlled telescope.Look Ahead Plan: An EVA is planned in the morning to explore Special Region. Half of the crew will stay at the base to work, as usual, on their experiments. The rest of the day will be mainly devoted to these experiments.Anomalies in work: No issues.Weather: Hot, bright and sunny all day.Crew Physical Status: Twisted ankle still bloated (See HSO reports)EVA: The aim of this third EVA was to recover the Opportunity rover.

crew 211 - 23/04/2019," After the daily check-up performed by the HSO as part of his experiment, we enjoy a nice breakfast together. An EVA was planned at 9 am but as the Curiosity rover was not fully charged, we decided to postpone it. Most of the crew members worked therefore on their respective experiments while the crew astronomer and crew scientist got their first shots of the sun. We then worked altogether during the noon break on the writing of a Martian constitution with the crew journalist. During the early afternoon, some crew members prepared the first successful Martian bread. Half of the crew left at 4 pm for the planned EVA to Candor Chasma to look for possible shelters in case of high solar activity.Look Ahead Plan: An EVA is planned in the morning to get back Opportunity near Candor Chasma and take additional soil samples. Half of the crew will stay at the base to work on their experiments. The crew astronomer will continue to take pictures of the sun in the morning and schedule a few observations with the Celestron telescope to get images from quasars. This will allow her to infer their luminosity and determine the evolution of their activity. The rest of the day will be devoted to the experiments.Anomalies in work: No issues.Weather: Hot, bright and sunny all day.Crew Physical Status: Good, yesterday’s twisted ankle is less painful.EVA: The aim of this second EVA was to explore the Candor Chasma region and look for caves. Underground structures could indeed be very helpful to protect the crew from solar wind/radiation in the case of increasing solar activity and CMEs (Coronal Mass Ejections). Unfortunately no caves have been found and we lost Opportunity near Candor Chasma. We’ll try to get the rover back during tomorrow’s EVA.Reports to be filed: Journalist Report, GreenHab Report , HSO report, Astronomer Report, Operations Report, EVA report, EVA Request, Daily Photo Report"
crew 211 - 22/04/2019," We start the day with a fitness session of 15 minutes which definitely helped some crew members to wake up. After the breakfast, we spent one hour and a half to clean the Hab. Most of the crew members have then started their respective experiments (see crew scientist report) while the crew astronomer started to work on the solar telescope. After the lunch, we all worked on our experiments until 4 pm when half of the crew went in EVA. As the UCL to Mars crew likes challenges, we will try tonight to prepare the first Martian Sushis and end the day with a meeting to discuss about today’s achievements and tomorrow’s objectives.Look Ahead Plan: An EVA is planned in the morning to explore the Candor Chasma. Half of the crew will stay at the base to work on their experiments. Depending on the weather, the crew astronomer will try to get the first pictures of the sun and observed some fainter structures as the visual observations didn’t reveal any large perturbations in the solar atmosphere. The afternoon will again be devoted to the experiments.Anomalies in work: Water tank pump leaking, water heater and heater in the Hab lab not workingWeather: Hot, sunny and fresh breeze.Crew Physical Status: Good except for one of the crew member who twisted his ankle.EVA: We have had our first EVA this afternoon which lasted for two hours. We traveled to the hills on the left of the Cow Dung Road between the Robert’S Rock Garden and Zurbin’s head to take a few soil samples to be used by Chloé, the GreenHab officer, for one of her two experiments. The EVA went very well and the sunny weather allowed us to take some beautiful pictures of the Martian environment surrounding the MDRS.Reports to be filed: Journalist Report, GreenHab Report , HSO report, Operations Report,Astronomy Report, Scientist Report, EVA report, EVA Request, Daily Photo Report"
crew 211 - 20/04/2019,"Today was a day of traveling and discovering the MDRS. Five members of the crew arrived at the station at about 1:30 pm.

crew 210 - 18/04/2019," This morning through to early afternoon our crew participated in a Livestream with Discover the Universe, engaging over 150 classrooms live with a presentation and Q and A about Mars, the Mars Society, and MDRS. This presentation will soon be uploaded to YouTube where it will continue on as a legacy outreach component of crew 210(http://www.discovertheuniverse.ca/workshop/special-webinar-live-from-mars-april2019/).After a water run into Hanksville, our team continued to process our field samples in the Science Dome and will continue to do so tomorrow. By recording physical characteristics of the soil samples taken from our quadrats, we hope to discover the factors driving plant diversity (or the lack thereof) in the different ecological areas around MDRS.Look Ahead Plan: We plan on continuing our work in the Science Dome tomorrow and will work on putting together a plan for our multi-year biodiversity inventory.Anomalies in work: No issues.Weather: Bright and sunny all day.Crew Physical Status: Good.EVA: We presented out Livestream from the area just north of ""Zubrin’s Head"" on the west side of Cow Dung Read, south of the blind corner on the road.Reports to be filed: GreenHab Report, Operation Report, Science Report, Daily Photo Report"
crew 210 - 17/04/2019," Today we continued our outreach efforts on social media, including answering questions on our Reddit ""Ask a Martian Anything"", and uploaded a Facebook update video. Four of the crew went to Copernicus Valley to continue transect and quadrat sampling, where we discovered new plant records for the MDRS area, including a stinkweed (Cleomella palmeriana). After a beautiful ride out and back, we returned home to the hab for lunch. In the afternoon we hiked up to the top of Hab Ridge just to the west of MDRS to finish our quadrat sampling. We returned to the hab around 6, and we plan on spending the evening processing samples and pressing plants in the Science Dome.Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow AM we will conduct livestream outreach broadcasts (one in French and one in English) in partnership with Discover The Universe and Live It. In the afternoon we will continue to process samples in the science dome, and will meet to discuss next steps for our multi-year program.Anomalies in work: No problems.Weather: Bright and SunnyCrew Physical Status: Good.

In the afternoon four crew members hiked up to Hab Ridge for additional quadrat surveys.Reports to be file: GreenHab Report, Operations Report, Photo Report"
crew 210 - 16/04/2019," (This morning we hosted a representative from the local Bureau of Land Management Office, therefore our team left for EVA in the early afternoon. We visited two sites east of the hab along the Cactus Road to survey vegetation using quadrats at two pre-determined sites – details for this sampling will be covered in the science report. At these sites we made additional plant and lichen collections for our biodiversity survey project. At the end of the day we proceeded to Hanksville to host an “Ask a Martian Anything” on Reddit.Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow we plan on visiting three more sites to finish our quadrat surveys, and to process the plants collected today in the hab science dome.Anomalies in work: No issues to report.Weather: Good weather (though slightly cold and overcast) until we returned home from our EVA, and which point rain and hail started over us.Crew Physical Status: Nominal.EVA: We drove along Cactus Road east of the station and sampled two sites along the route for our quadrat surveys.Reports to be file: Operations Report, GreenHab Report, Photo Report, Science Report"
crew 210 - 15/04/2019," This morning, after the requisite coffee, Crew 210 pressed the plants collected during yesterdays excursion to Salt Creek and the Burpee Quarry. By squishing the plant specimens between cardboard and drying them out, the team is left with a flat plant that, of stored correctly, will last for hundreds of years. These specimens, accompanied by a label indicating the location and date of collection, will serve as the proof that these plants were found growing at a specific place and time, and will make up the backbone of our first planned publication from this program.Our team devoted the rest of this sol to gathering supplies essential to hab and rover systems. Shannon made a water run to Hanksville, while the rest of 210 went to Bicknel for ATV batteries and supplies to build a quadrat for our ecological work. On our return to MDRS our team was able to repair one more ATV, three of these are now operational.While completing both our scientific and technical work for the day we were also able to continue our social outreach efforts, including posting video of our plant pressing adventures to Twitter and Facebook, preparing for an “Ask a Martian Anything” on Reddit tomorrow night, and telling our “Martian” tales on social media.All in all, another beautiful day in that special place that straddles the line between our unique planet and the one we’d next like to visit.Look Ahead Plan: Now equipped with a square-meter quadrat for ecological sampling, we will plan on spending tomorrow (sol 4), doing transects and quadrats within the MDRS operational area. At these sites we will document the number of species, percent cover, and functional groups of the plant and lichen communities, and record abiotic variables such as soil moisture content, pH, and coarseness. New plant and lichen species found on EVA will also be collected.A Bureau of Land Management representative is scheduled to visit MDRS tomorrow morning, so we will meet with them before starting our sampling EVA.Anomalies in work: No.Weather: Cloudy in the am, clearing by mid-day.Crew Physical Status: Good.EVA: no EVAs at MDRS, but Shannon made a water and supply run to Hanksville, and the remainder of the crew made a supply run to Bicknell.Reports to be filed:Sol SummaryOperations ReportGreenHab ReportPhoto Report"
crew 209 - 14/04/2019,"Anywhere is walking distance if you’ve got the timeBefore departing MDRS for a day of botanical sampling, crew 210 spent the morning working on social media outreach and (importantly), fueling up on coffee. While team members emptied the hab car water tank (filled last night in Hanksville), other crew members continued to repair the hab tunnels. The full team (five humans and two space dogs) left the station at 11:30.After refueling the hab car in Hanksville, we drove to the Factory Butte access road and sampled plants and lichens at the Valley of the Stars and at Salt Creek. We returned to Cow Dung Road and went to continue our plant sampling outside of the Burpee Dinosaur QuarryWhen we went to return to MDRS the hab car did not initially start, so Mike Irvine and myself hiked back to the hab from the quarry to retrieve the crew car. However, just as we returned to the hab we heard from the rest of the team over the radio that they were able to restart the car and they made their way back to MDRS.Tomorrow the team will travel to Loa in the morning to retrieve parts for the ATVs, and plan on sampling around the hab (time-permitting) in the afternoon."
crew 209 - 13/04/2019,"Entry, Descent, and LandingCrew 210 arrived at the Mars Desert Research Station mid-afternoon today. Consisting of biologists and outreach specialists from across North America, crew 210 will spend the next week conducting a biodiversity survey and ecological inventory of the MDRS area outside of sim. Our team includes:· Dr. Shannon Rupert, director of the Mars Desert Research station, and desert ecologist.· David Murray, crew 210 co-lead, MDRS GreenHab director, and desert ecologist.· Paul Sokoloff, crew 2010 co-lead and botanist at the Canadian Museum of Nature.· Samantha McBeth, polar biologist, expedition guide, and outreach coordinator.· Mike Irvine, co-founder of Live It and outreach coordinator.We spent this afternoon addressing logistical needs around the station, including some repairs of the hab tunnels, two water runs into Hanksville, and repairs to ATVs. We will likely need to run additional errands on Monday, so tomorrow we will begin our sampling program by surveying the vegetation and sampling around Salt Creek, on the Factory Butte road.This spring has been very lush around MDRS and the “Martian” hills are green with peppergrass and evening primrose, so we are eager to begin our science program in the hopes of finding new plant records for MDRS, and to contribute to long-term ecological monitoring at the station.You can follow our ""Martian"" adventures on Twitter (@LiveItearth, @Lady_McBeth_, @paul_sokoloff, @pillowdavid17), and by following #MDRS210 and #MarsBioUntil tomorrow,Paul S, on behalf of crew 210"

We stayed up there for more than 2,5 hours. After that, we ate breakfast and got ready for our hike.At 10:00 am we took Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity to go towards the Copernicus road. It was a beautiful hike, we walked and sunbathed for a good amount of time. We didn’t have any time constraints because the last news we had was that Crew 207 would only arrive tonight around 08:00 pm.We came back at the Hab around 01:30 pm, and at this point, Atila gave us the news that Crew 207 would arrive in an hour. We had to rush to finish cleaning the Hab and prepare lunch. But the crew arrived later and we ate alone.The handover went really well, we trained them with the time we had and talked a little about our research and our lives. We will go to Stan’s Burger around 08:00 pm so the COMMS window has to be managed beforehand.Look ahead plan: Tomorrow we will get up at 06:00 am to drive back to Grand Junction, rent a car and head straight to Denver, it’s gonna be a long day.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Sunny all dayCrew physical status: FineEVA: Copernicus explorationReports to be filed: GreenHab, Journalist, Operation, EVA Request, EVA Report"
crew 206 - 15/03/2019,": Today is our last “routine” day. We gave everything we had for the workout session, we ate quickly to be ready on time for the EVA which was earlier than usual. Half of the crew went exploring the ends of Galileo road while the other half started packing and continued cleaning the Hab, with only a few rest moments in the morning. The EVA teamed wrapped up the Weather station and LOAC disassembly around 10:30 am, and after they had arranged their equipment we started cleaning the lower deck. Everyone has a lot to do today, and we kept this fast pace all day long. At 11:30 am we started working on the daily reports and the preparation of lunch. After a copious meal, we went all around the station to pack our small equipment, film some last scenes and gather the last experimentaldata. Even on this busy day we had to do the TELEOP session and the VR experiment, for the last time. The important end of mission reports are already done, so we are a little ahead of schedule. After the VR session, at 18h00, we opened the main airlock to breathe some fresh and absorb the sunlight. This is the end, we stayed outside for more than 45 minutes, taking in the surroundings for one last time. We are happy of the work we did, the experiences we lived and the memories we formed.Look ahead plan : We are looking forward to meeting Crew 207, it will feel good to meet some new faces after 3 weeks of isolation. There is still work to do before leaving but the vast majority has been done. We will keep some personal time tomorrow morning to watch the sunrise from the Hab ridge, and perhaps jog towards the Mesa.Anomalies in work : NoneWeather : Sunny all dayCrew physical status : FineEVA : Weather station and LOAC disassembly and Galileo road explorationReports to be filed : GreenHab, Journalist, Operation, EVA Request, EVA Report"
crew 206 - 14/03/2019,": This night it was a little bit colder in the Hab,we all slept much better. The day started beautifully, but unfortunatelyduring our morning workout one of the crew members pulled a few muscleson his/her back. It hurt pretty bad but it’s nothing serious. He/hertherefore couldn’t go on EVA, so I took the leadership of this EVA.After changing the LOAC battery we took the rovers to go to galileoroad. Once there we continued driving a little until we saw the plainand the river bank ahead of us. At this point we started walking. It wasa beautifull hike, the scenery was out of this world, we walked to thebegining of Candor Chasma. At this point we decided to head back to therovers in case one of us started to feel to tired. We ended the EVA at11:20 am without any issue. After a nice lunch, we started cleaning thewhole Hab, for more than an hour. We will continue tomorrw and saturday.Before the VR experiment we also filmed some short videos for frenchmiddle school students, as part of our association’s sciencepopularization for underpriviledge children.Look ahead plan : Tomorrow will be split in two parts : finishing ourlast experiments and finishing cleaning and tidying up the Hab.Anomalies in work : NoneWeather : Cloudy up to 11:00 am, sunny afterwards.Crew physical status : One of the crew members has a strong back ache,but nothing serious.EVA : Weather station maintenance and Galileo road explorationReports to be filed : GreenHab, Journalist, Operation, EVA Request, EVAReport, HSO Report"
crew 206 - 13/03/2019,": In two days we are going to break the simulationand wrap up all our experiments, it will be the end of a greatadventure. We are feeling this, everything is going faster, days areflying by. We are savouring these last days. This morning went fine,although we had to shorten our EVA. While we were exploring, and afterthe weather station maintenance, the wind started increasing greatly, tothe point where we hard a hard time hearing ourselves in the radio andwe were being pushed around. We headed straight back to the rovers anddrove back to the Hab. Nothing bad happened. The wind has been blowingstrong since then. The weather station is still up. This afternoon wasquite busy : the TELEOP session went fine and due to planningconstraints we all had to watch VR videos, which took some time. All ourexperiments are going fine, although the crew is being less attentive towater consumption measurement.Look ahead plan : Tomorrow’s EVA will be used to test the prototypespace suit again.Anomalies in work : NoneWeather : Cloudy all day, very windy since 10:00 amCrew physical status : FineEVA : Weather station maintenance and South MDRS explorationReports to be filed : GreenHab, Journalist, Operation, EVA Request, EVAReport"
crew 206 - 12/03/2019,": This morning we managed to get up a little earlier and to start the workout session on time. The planned EVA went fine. The purpose was to change the LOAC’s battery and to continue training the non-veteran crew members, two of them will be commanders next year, so it is very important to have every detail of a MDRS mission mastered. They went to white rock canyon to do some exploration and take some footage. Gaspard’s app also worked today : he is developing an app to improve EVA tracking by allowing the leader to enter data on his phone only by clicking on the screen (with the glove). This app was developed by Louis Mangin (Crew 189 Commander) last year, and this app was further developed by Gaspard this year. This afternoon we didn’t have any TELEOP session so we took some time for ourselves. More than half of the crew took a nap, and we are feeling better tonight. The VR videos we watched are quite impressive, beautifull and relaxing. The crew is feeling well this last week and will work as hard as the two other weeks.Look ahead plan : In the next few days, for our last EVAs we will try to explore some places we haven’t explored yet, and start analysing some of the collected data we can analyse.Anomalies in work : NoneWeather : Cloudy all dayCrew physical status : FineEVA : LOAC Maintenance and White Rock Canyon explorationReports to be filed : GreenHab, Journalist, Operation, EVA Request, EVA Report"
crew 206 - 11/03/2019,": We woke up still tired this morning, butmotivated to finish the mission as best we could. We continued filming alot of different scenes all day, this kind of changes our everydayexperience. This morning’s EVA was a success : we installed the weatherstation and the LOAC again, but we anchored the base much more stronglyto the ground, it seems perfectly aligned, and we are getting the data.This has also ended the 4 days of interior measurements, we are eager tosee the results of air quality we are breathing. This afternoon wecontinued the TELEOP sessions, everything is running fine and we are notencountering issues anymore. It feels good to finally have a workingset-sup after so much work. It’s also our last VR week, we are seeingsome pretty footage for the last time.Look ahead plan : Tomorrow we will change the LOAC battery to make sureit doesn’t turn off, we will try to visit white rock canyon and we willpursue our experiments.Anomalies in work : NoneWeather : Quite sunny until 4:30 pm, Cloudy after thatCrew physical status : FineEVA : LOAC and weather station installationReports to be filed : GreenHab, Journalist, Operation, EVA Request, EVAReport"
crew 206 - 10/03/2019,": Today was our rest day, se didn’t put any alarmsfor waking up, with the day light saving hour change we woke up around09-10:00 am to have breakfast. It feels really good to take a day offand not follow any schedule. We spent most of the day playing cards andtalking, we saw a funny stupid movie before lunch. We will be much moreefficient and motivated tomorrow and the rest of the day. As every daywe had our debating time, that was about humour and its impacts on thesociety for today.Our Crew writer explained us his plan for our Crew post mission videoand we have started the shootings today.Look ahead plan : This week we have to plan an EVA to bring the LOAC outof the station again, we have gathered enough data inside the station.Anomalies in work : NoneWeather : Cloudy all day with a few sunshinesCrew physical status : FineEVA : NoneReports to be filed : GreenHab, Journalist, Operation, EVA Request"
crew 206 - 09/03/2019," It is getting harder and harder for me to wake up in the morning, but I still stick to the morning routine, as all of the crew does. Today is the last working day of our week, and we worked well.The EVA went beautifully. We explored the east and west Kissing Camels ridges and took great pictures. The EVA was also meant to continue the tests of our prototype simulation space suit. The little upgrades that were made improved the suit quite a bit: it was less hard to carry, ventilation and sun protection worked better and the battery lasted more than long enough for the whole EVA.This afternoon also saw the completion of the TELEOP second week: we managed to gather additional data to catch up on the sessions that were missed, and I haven’t encountered any additional issues with the physical rover (great difference with last year’s sessions). We ended this work week with the VR session, that also allowed us to talk about the videos we had seen, and opinions differ regarding what video was preferred.Look ahead plan: Tomorrow will be a rest day, we will still have towork on our rotation video and on a few experiments, but it will becalmer than today.Anomalies in work : NoneWeather : Cloudy all day with some sunshine.Crew physical status : FineEVA : Kissing CamelsReports to be filed : GreenHab, Journalist, Operation, EVA Report"
crew 206 - 08/03/2019,": Since the begining of the week we are waking upone or two minutes later every day, tomorrow we will have to get back intrack ! We still do our workout sessions as seriously as the first daythough, our scores have greatly increased. With the lack of an EVA wedecided to clean the Hab again, the dust settles everywhere so quicklythat it’s a necessity. We also had some long discussions on the methodswe use to measure the water consuption of flushes, we have to continueaveraging the water volume over many toilet flushes. For lunch weprepared some pizzas, we ate a wonderfull lunch that made us all happy.After that we played some Tarot, a popular french card game. In theafternoon there was a TELEOP session, it worked fine, this experiment isback on track ! As planned, there was also a VR session, we arecontinuing to gather data.Look ahead plan : We hope to go on EVA tomorrow but the weather doesn’tseem promising, so we might just continue our indoor experiments in thenext days.Anomalies in work : NoneWeather : Cloudy all day with a few sunshinesCrew physical status : FineEVA : NoneReports to be filed : GreenHab, Journalist, Operation, EVA Request isweather allows it"
crew 206 - 07/03/2019,": Waking up is becoming harder and harder for me, even if I sleep as much as before. Some of us sleep better and some of us sleep worse than usual, confinement and isolation have different effects on different people. We are nonetheless sticking to our strict daily routine : wake up at 07:00 am, sport and breakfast. The EVA’s purpose was to asses the damage on the weather station (that tipped over yesterday due to the winds) and the LOAC, and to dismantle the instruments to bring them back to the Hab. The weather cock on the station broke, but the sensor is still operationnal. The rest of the equipment is intact. For the rest of the EVA the team attached more tightly all the tarps that cover the tunnels.Today is Cerise’s birthday, so the crew prepared a very nice lunch, and Cerise prepared a great chocolate cake. We had a very nice time. In the afternoon we were able to run a digital TELEOP session with the new computer station we received, so we are now collecting twice as much data, things all finaly looking good for TELEOP. The wind is sporadically blowing hard on the station, we hope that it won’t be too bad in the next few days.Look ahead plan : Almost all our experiments are running fine, except the weather station. We will take advantage of the fact that the LOAC is inside to measure the quality of the air we breathe.Anomalies in work : NoneWeather : Sunny between 11 am and 12 am, Cloudy for the rest of the dayCrew physical status : FineEVA : LOAC and weather station dismantlingReports to be filed : GreenHab, Journalist, Operation, EVA Report, EVA Request"
crew 206 - 06/03/2019,": We got up a little after 07:00 am to begin the work out. The sun wasn’t shining this morning, but we were feeling great. At 09:00 am we were almost ready for EVA, the new LOAC battery was fully charged. Outside the ground was pretty dry, we went straight to the weather station to do a quick maintenance. After that we went north instead of going to kissing camels, CNN’s filming crew was still arriving, so we didn’t want to hold anyone up. After 10 minutes of driving we stopped to start our exploration. We discovered that the camera had no SD card, so we couldn’t take any pictures. We walked east towards a canyon that wasn’t noted on the map. After a little walking it started raining lightly, so by precaution we decided to go back to the rovers in case the rain didn’t stop, but after 4-5 minutes it did stop. We took the rovers to go to reservoir dam, to explore it. When the CNN filming crew left the Hab we went back to the Hab. During that time the two others were in the science dome. This afternoon I was interviewed by CNN, the rest of the crew worked on their experiments. In the afternoon the wind started to go up a lot, we noticed that it had tiped over the weather station and the LOAC, we need to fix it quickly.Look ahead plan : We hope to be able to go on EVA tomorrow to fix the LOAC, but the weather doesn’t look like it wants us to go out.Anomalies in work : NoneWeather : Cloudy all day, high winds in the afternoonCrew physical status : FineEVA : LOAC maintenance and Reservoir Dam explorationReports to be filed : GreenHab, Journalist, Operation, EVA Report, EVARequest, Science Report"

crew 206 - 05/03/2019,": Yesterday night we went to the observatory to take a look at the sky and take some pictures. There was almost no clouds, and the air was pretty clear. I had an issue with my camera lens, so I only took a couple nice pictures. As usual everyone got out of bed at 07:00 am for the daily workout. It’s still as hard, even if we’re getting used to it. After that we ate breakfast and prepared for the EVA. We went to attach a rain protection to the LOAC. It’s very simple, probably not as effective as I’d wish, but it’s good enough for now. After that we went up to the Hab ridge. The view is still as impressive and beautiful, even after a year. I took some great pictures. Cerise felt sick this morning, so she didn’t go on the EVA, and took advantage of this time to finish the Mars puzzle (unfortunately there is 3 missing pieces). After lunch, 5 of us took a long nap. It didn’t help me that much, I’m feeling sleepy since then and Aurélien, our XO, feels also quite sleepy. I haven’t made some progress on TELEOP today, our extra charger is supposed to arrive tomorrow. At least I have a set-up that works, I’m gathering a part of the data I planned on gathering. After that is was a quiet day.Look ahead plan : We are now planning all our filming sessions for the mission video, it will take some time and some work, but it should look good !Anomalies in work : NoneWeather : Sunny in the morning, Cloudy in the afternoonCrew physical status : FineEVA : LOAC maintenance and Hab Ridge explorationReports to be filed : GreenHab, Journalist, Operation, EVA Report, EVA Request"
crew 206 - 04/03/2019,": At 07:00 am everyone got out of bed easily and with energy. The 3 of us that recorded our workout scores (as planned, the 3 others will record their scores tomorrow) beat last week’s scores. The ground was too humid to go on EVA, so we had to change a few activities on the planning. The EVA was moved to the afternoon, and the TELEOP session was moved to tomorrow. In the morning we weren’t sure that we would be able to go on EVA. In the morning we worked on our expriments and prepared a nice lunch for Aurélien’s Birthday (our executive officer). Around 14:00, the afternoon EVA was approved, and Gaspard, the EVA leader, took the first step outside on a dry ground. The EVA team managed to do everything that was planned on the request. We made some bread in the afternoon. We also learned that they had been a earthquake between 10 am and 11 am, but no one noticed anything.

crew 206 - 03/03/2019," This morning there was no wake up alarms, but we all got up before 09:00 am. We ate pancakes and started looking for some fun games to play. The best one we found was Monopoly Deal, it’s simple, fast and fun, and we loved it. While some of us started working on the Mars puzzle in the morning, the rest of us prepared some bread and a ""gratin dauphinois"" (potatoes cooked in cream and cheese, baked in the oven). We ate really well, great for crew morale! The bread also looks great, we kept it for dinner. We played Monopoly a good part of the afternoon, Cerise made some good progress on the puzzle, and after that we read a bit and worked on our reports. To sum up it was a calm day which we really enjoyed!Look ahead plan: Tomorrow we hope we will be able to go on EVA to finally test the prototype space suit.

crew 206 - 02/03/2019," Waking up was even harder today. Even if we didn’t have a planned EVA we got up at 07:00 to workout. After breakfast, we spent a little more than an hour to clean the Hab, upper and lower deck. It was necessary, there was dust everywhere. Before lunch, half of us went to the GreenHab to plant some watercress, the rest of us helped Cerise to bake some cookies. It started raining when we started preparing lunch. After that most of us went to take a nap.After 02:30 pm I started working on TELEOP again. I still don’t understand the connection issues I’m having, the experiment doesn’t work in the conditions I tested in Toulouse before leaving or even in the conditions that worked during MDRS mission 189. But I managed to find a set-up that worked: the rover and the subject in the science dome. It’s not ideal, it might change the analysis of the results but at least it allowed me to get some data. The simulated rover’s computer still doesn’t work, but we are not losing hope!Tonight is going to be a rest night, we are going to watch a French comedy movie.Look ahead plan: Tomorrow is our rest day, we will find some nice board games to play and sleep as much as we can.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Cloudy all day, started raining at 12hCrew physical status: FineEVA : None, Bad WeatherReports to be filed: GreenHab, Journalist, Operation"

Muscle aches have gone but sport was hard nonetheless.Benjamin, Cerise and Gaspard went by foot on top of the Hab ridge fortheir EVA. They loved the view and did a wonderfull EVA, but they werekind of hot around 10:00 am. Aurélien, Norbert and I worked on variousprojects in the Hab. Norbert worked in the GreenHab, Aurélien preparedsome lunch while I tried to fix some issues with the TELEOP experiment.There’s some improvement, but it’s not yet done. We ate a light lunch,and after that we talked for a while. We are all feeling some effects ofisolation and confinement, but we are doing fine. Some of us took a napduring the afternoon while others worked on their experiment. Aurélienprepared some bread for diner, it looks great.

crew 206 - 28/02/2019," Muscle aches from the morning workout have finally passed, it feels pretty good. Our sleep patterns are getting better. This morning’s EVA’s purpose was to change the LOAC battery (which went perfectly) and to explore White Rock Canyon. The rovers performed better than yesterday, we managed to arrive at White Rock Canyon with more than 85% of charge. The exploration lasted for about 1h30, the view was exceptional and we took great pictures. The mud is still bothering, but nothing that we can’t overcome. We arrived at the Hab a little tired. For lunch, we ate pasta and we cooked our first bread!This afternoon I worked on TELEOP again, but I encountered new issues: the computer charger is broken, and we haven’t found an equivalent one. I managed to connect the physical rover to my computer by there is still connection issues. To sum up: both TELEOP versions are currently not working. It was a hard day for me, but the rest of the crew had more luck. Cerise got a response from the BioMérieux lab: our water is not infected (we feared there were some bacteria), it’s safe to drink, but it’s not as clean as tap water. We are still experiencing internet issues, it seems to be coming from the router (I couldn’t connect before 07:08 pm).Look ahead plan: Tomorrow will be a regular day, we will try to fix some issues on our experiments.

crew 206 - 27/02/2019,": Once again we got out of bed at 07:00 am toworkout, but everybody had slept well, we went to bed early yesterday.Our Dreem Headbands showed that we had an effective time of sleepranging from 6h20 and 8h20, I slept more than everyone else ! Afterbreakfast we prepared the EVA. It was the first EVA without a veteran,Aurélien was EVA leader. It went very well, Opportunity’s batterydecreased quickly so they went for plan B. They explored the moon areas.During the EVA Cerise and I cleaned the Hab’s lower and upper deck. Ithen took care of the water consumption data : on Sol 2 (yesterday) weused 77,4L (20,5 Gallons), with 41% for the GreenHab, 25% for drinking,13% for flushes, 6% for dishes, 5% for cooking, 2% for hygiene (noshowers yet) and 8% of unmeasured consumption. Unmeasured consumptioncomes from inaccuracies and small mistakes in counting, this part ofdaily consumption should decrease during the mission. After lunch,everyone worked on their experiments (except me, I took a good nap).Aurélien, Benjamin, Gaspard and Norbert did some pre-EVA tests on theirspace suit, all the vital functions work, but it still needs to beimproved the ergonomic standpoint. Cerise worked on Aquapad to measurethe microbial quality of our water. First results suggest that the waterdrinkability is problematic, but it is surely a manipulation or datainterpretation, we have sent a mail to the BioMérieux laboratories tohave an explanation. Before the COMMS, as planned, we participated to theVirtual Reality experiment.Look ahead plan : Tomorrow is once again going to be a busy day, we have4 experiments planned.

crew 206 - 26/02/2019,": Today we slept half an hour more than yesterday, we woke at 07:00 am. After our 30 minutes workout, we ate quickly to have enough time to prepare our EVA. We had to gather all the necessary tools and organise the different pieces of the weather station and the LOAC. Around 09:00 am, we were almost ready. We left the airlock at 09:17 am, and took the rovers to carry our equipment to the site we had found on EVA #1. The installation went fine, even though we had to go back to the Hab twice to get additional tools. The two instruments are installed, but we still have to make some adjustments. We finished the EVA at 10:30 am. After that we worked on our experiments and our reports. For lunch Aurélien and Norbert made some pizzas, they were great. The first main activity of the afternoon was TELEOP, the human factor experiment. We had an issue with the tele-operated rover, so today we only worked with the simulated rover. This part of the experiment worked fine. After that we participated in the Virtual Reality experiment once again.Look ahead plan : Tomorrow we will start working on the simulation space suit, and it will also be a little rest day for Cerise and I that did two EVAs in a row.

crew 206 - 25/02/2019,": After our change of schedule for this morning’s EVA, we had to get out of bed at 06:30 am. A few minutes after that we started our daily physical training. We managed to start breakfast around 07:10 am. We had a hard time making pretty pancakes with the old pan we have. We managed to start preparing for the EVA at 07:40 am. This first EVA is mainly used to train the new crew members, but we also looked for a appropriate spot to install our two instruments, LOAC and the weather station. But this EVA was very annoying for me: 10 minutes after the beginning my visor was completely fogged, but we managed to finish the EVA (I didn’t drive obviously). Otherwise the EVA went very smoothly. After lunch, around 02:00 pm, everyone went their own way to prepare their experiments. Cerise worked on Aquapad, to test the microbiological quality of our drinking water, Aurélien went to the solar observatory to get used to it, Norbert worked on his plants. After that we all participated to the virtual reality (VR) experiment. Its goal is to study the efficiency of VR as a countermeasure to confinement and isolation.Look ahead plan : Tomorrow will be a big day, a lot of our main experiments will be installed and performed for the first time, so we are preparing as much as we can today. The crew is slowly getting used to the life in the station.

Following some last cleaning around the Hab, the crew took the opportunity of being out of sim to do some hiking around North Bridge. Upon our return, we met Crew 206 coming directly from Supaero (France). They will be taking over the operations here after our departure tomorrow. We spent the afternoon training them on all details about the “Martian life” and took the usual official crew pictures. At night we have the chance to enjoy delicious hamburgers together in Hanksville.Tomorrow we will start our “re-entry back to Earth”. After our mission on Mars, the “de-orbiting period” to get back to normal life might be challenging!

crew 205 - 21/02/2019," Today was a quiet day. We woke up surrounded by a white Martian landscape. The snowfall from last night left us with approximately 10 cm of snow on the ground. The Martian weather has been challenging our mission during the past days but despite those challenges, we have been advancing well in our research projects.It has been 11 days since we arrived to these lands. We can see the end of our mission rising on the horizon. As such, the crew focused today on wrapping up the different projects, start the deep cleaning of the RAM, Science Dome and GreenHab. We also started drafting our mission summary and filmed some last outreach videos. As usual, we have enjoyed a fantastic lunch prepared by our “Martian Chef de Cuisine” Hannah which mastered some home-made Martian Pizza.Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow we will perform a deep cleaning of the Hab to make sure everything is ready for the next crew, finish up our mission summary, take some last official pictures and start packing to come back to “Earth”.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Consistent snow during most of the day.Crew Physical Status: NominalEVA: NoneReports to be filed: Sol Summary, Journalist Report, GreenHab Report, Operations Report, EVA request (just kidding  we know it is fully covered in white outside)"
crew 205 - 20/02/2019," We woke up to an overcast sky and biscuits with sausage gravy. The crew worked on a jigsaw puzzle of Mars while drinking their morning coffee. The EVA 14 team left the Hab at 1300 and quickly realized that Spirit and Opportunity did not fully charge. Atila reset the RAM’s external breaker which solved the problem. Approximately one hour later, the EVA 14 team set out again towards Candor Chasma on Spirit and Curiosity. However, when they had nearly reached their destination, they noticed fast-moving clouds and decided to return to the Hab to prevent weather-related issues. Later in the afternoon, light precipitation occurred while the crew ate chocolate lava cake and continued to piece together the puzzle. We finished the evening by enjoying movies from the Hab collection. Apollo 13 is a crew favorite.Look Ahead Plan: If weather and ground conditions allow, although it currently seems unlikely, part of the crew will go on EVA 15 to The Moon. We will continue to work on developing Standard Operating Procedures for future crews.Anomalies in work: Spirit and Opportunity did not fully charge. Resetting the RAM’s external breaker fixed the issue.Weather: Overcast, light flurries starting at 1530Crew Physical Status: NominalEVA: EVA 14Reports to be filed: Sol Summary, Journalist Report, GreenHab Report, Operations Report, EVA report, EVA request"
crew 205 - 19/02/2019," The bad weather last night affected today’s activities. EVA plans were cancelled last night, and astronomical observations submitted a few days ago needed to wait for an extra night. This morning the crew woke up with an exceptional white view of the Martian landscape from the Hab window. While having breakfast, the white bright snow was melting down, and as we approached lunch time, the muddy Martian land started to finally appear.Duties in the Hab, and its facilities started just after finishing breakfast as planned last night. Dave, Nathan and Veronica went to the Science Dome to clean, measure and characterize the samples. In fact, those samples made the whole crew so excited, and was the main topic of today and last night. Our XO today, Hannah, prepared lunch for the crew with the help of Dan. Maria, continued to work hard for our outreach movie, this time, with the help of Natalia. Natalia started preparing a guideline document for future crews and discussed with the commander of the day, Ghanim.In addition to the above work, the crew continued the normal daily maintenance, cleaning of the Hab and writing reports as usual. The only new duty was to sweep out the snow accumulated in the tunnel to avoid muddy walk way.In the night, Hannah cooked us a delicious fried rice with chicken, and the crew prepared to watch the Apollo 13 Film.Anomalies: EVA cancelledWeather: partly cloudyReports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, Journalist Report."
crew 205 - 18/02/2019," The EVA suits have been fixed last night successfully.This morning the crew woke up with the smell of pancakes with blueberry and apple toppings prepared by commander Maria with a banana milkshake to top it off.The planned EVA had a chance of 30% snow but when we looked outside the window, we just could see white everywhere. Therefore, the decision was made to cancel the EVA.It gave us the chance to catch up with science and maintenance of the habitat. The crew astronomer for the day is Natalia and she submitted a new request with the help of Ghanim who is today’s XO, for the Orion nebula as yesterday no new observation could be made.Veronica and Dave exchanged the water filter. The tunnels were brushed to clean them from snow. Nathan continued the characterization of the samples. He made some interesting observation as some of the samples that were taken yesterday turned out to be fossilized shells which is very exciting as this means it is a sign of a former sea at the Moon area. In the afternoon he took care of the ISRU plants in the Greenhab which luckily survived the night.Dave prepared some noodle soup and tonight we are getting salmon and hushpuppies and rice by comms officer Hannah.Besides that, the crew edited some of the videos and took some extra images for the outreach project.The crew journalist of today took some nice pictures of the hab in snow and the fossil shells.After dinner, we’re hopefully going to play some games or watch a movie as a team.Look ahead plan: The crew intends to conduct the EVA planned for today again, for tomorrow if the weather outside allows it. In addition, the science continues with characterization and observation of the Arabidopsisseedlings and their development in the regolith substrate and the editing of the videos will continue.Anomalies: EVA cancelledWeather: snow all dayReports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, Journalist Report, Astronomy Report"
crew 205 - 17/02/2019," This morning began in spectacular fashion thanks to the heroic efforts of Hannah, our crew’s Communication Officer, who woke up early to make us all cinnamon buns to start the day right. The morning’s EVA team was geared up for their expedition in good time and left only a few minutes later than scheduled. They drove Opportunity and Curiosity to within a few hundred metres of Copernicus Highway in the Moon Region before pulling over. The rest of their EVA was accomplished on foot in the Grey Moon area, and succeeded in bringing back samples from 9 different sites – including the fossilised shells’ of ancient sea creatures! The EVA team were monitoring the weather and as they noticed heavy clouds approaching (likely with snow) from the southern mountain and skyline ridge, they decided to return to Hab. The reunited crew enjoyed a tasty soup of cheese and broccoli with added chicken for lunch. Not long after we finished, the crew noticed snow flurries beginning from the Hab’s windows. After 10 minutes or so they hadn’t stopped and so the decision was taken to cancel the afternoon’s EVA. Even after the snow eventually stopped, from the looks of the clouds surrounding our little oasis, we all agreed it was probably safer to have stayed and worked in the base itself.In the afternoon extra measures were taken to secure the maintenance of the base, including repairing any loose tunnel coverings (one had already begun blowing away), fixing the GreenHab door and later the EVA suits that have some faulty fans. For tonight, to keep away the cold, we have some Mars burgers made by Hannah featuring lettuce leaves from our very own GreenHab! After dinner, we’re hopefully going to find a movie from the newly reorganised DVD collection, perhaps even a Christmas film to reflect the weather. The weather outside may be frightful, but inside our home on Mars at MDRS, the company is most definitely delightful…Look ahead plan: If the weather outside tomorrow is safe, the crew intends to conduct an EVA, deep into Condor Chasma to retrieve samples from the harder to reach areas. The team for this will be mostly made up from those that didn’t get the chance to do an EVA this afternoon. This is provided the snow holds off overnight too. Now that the Journalist (Maria) has compiled all the crew interview videos she is hoping to start editing together our Crew Video, but for today and tomorrow it is her turn to be XO and CO. As always, science will continue in earnest at the base. Many samples from today and likely tomorrow morning are still to be analysed and catalogued fully, and also the final few Arabidopsis seedlings have been transferred to be grown in regolith substrate as part of our botanical ISRU experiment.Anomalies: NoneWeather: cloudy with snow clouds and flurries moving in from the SouthReports to be filed: Sol Summary, EVA report, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, Journalist Report, Astronomy Report, Science Report"
crew 205 - 16/02/2019," Unsure on whether the weather would permit today’s EVAs given last night’s warning of a high chance of rain and wind, crew 205 was pleasantly surprised to wake up to a sunny morning, which remained clear throughout the day, permitting both planned EVAs. The morning EVA’s crew was composed by the four men of crew 205 who went up to North Ridge and its surrounding foothills to collect samples. The four ladies used the morning to make ""Kaiserschmarrn"" (scrambled pancakes), write up documentation, and of course act as capcom to our bearded crew members. The girls’ EVA consisted on a drive to Kissing Camel in order to take drone footage at high altitude (and sneak in a ""Charlie’s Angels"" pose photo). After returning from the afternoon EVA (to a fresh pot of coffee made by the guys), we worked on writing our documentation and planning tomorrow’s EVAs. In the evening, the long-haired girls will have our once-every-3-day-super-water-efficient hair wash session which we always look forward too!Look ahead plan: We have two EVAs planned for tomorrow, a 4-hour morning one to ""The Moon"" and an shorter afternoon one to Hab ridge. Other than that, tomorrow’s HSO (Dave) and myself (tomorrow’s engineer) will be working on fixing some of the spacesuits, and the journalist wants to continue filming her interviews of the crew.Anomalies: NoneWeather: sunny and clear skies"
crew 205 - 15/02/2019," The weather on Mars this morning was much more pleasant than on Sol 4. The sky was clear, but the muddy conditions persisted until late morning when the heat of the day started to clear the landscape of its saturation. There was no EVA today due to the unsafe ground conditions, so the sol was spent catching up on paperwork, characterizing regolith samples in the Science Dome, cleaning, and working in the GreenHab. The ISRU project reached a pivotal point today, with the Arabidopsis thaliana germinations completed and the seedlings transferred to regolith samples collected on previous EVAs using an agar media plug. Those experiments are now in the GreenHab and will stay there for the duration of the experiment. The team also made headway on our EVA optimization project. We finished designing our quantitative study to evaluate the effectiveness of EVAs and will be applying the measure to upcoming EVAs. We also worked on designing pre and post check lists for future crews to make EVAs safer, more efficient, and easier which will be available at the end of the mission. The crew’s journalist worked all day on her media and outreach project, interviewing each crewmember about their role, and recording while everyone was working. She is also designing and outreach video for kids. After the communications window and an Irish meal of shepherd’s pie tonight, the team will have our nightly meeting and leadership handover to discuss tomorrow.Look Ahead Plan: Weather permitting tomorrow, the crew will go on EVA to continue geological sampling and testing of EVA checklists, procedures, and quantitative measures of effectiveness. Otherwise, we will continue refining the SOPs and other documentation to improve the workflow of future crews and continue to work in the laboratory. Tomorrow will also see another rotation of Commander and Executive Officer, so a new day will bring new leadership.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Partly cloudy with high winds throughout the day.Crew Physical Status: NominalEVA: NoneReports to be filed: Sol Summary, EVA request, Operations Report, GreenHab Report, Journalist Report, Astronomy Report, HSO Report"
crew 205 - 14/02/2019," Crew 205 awoke to overcast skies and the smell of bacon and eggs, as the Commander and Executive Officer cooked a breakfast of bacon, eggs, and toast prepared from homemade bread. Unfortunately, the only sunny things today were the egg yolks. The EVA team for EVA #07 left on schedule, but was recalled 45 minutes later as weather began to turn inclement. The EVA crew was in the airlock before any unsafe ground conditions occured, but they only completed the UAV test flight, and did not make it to the North Ridge. The rest of the crew helped the EVA team clean and store their EVA suits, before everyone headed upstairs for lunch. While having lunch, the crew engaged in a ""Secret Valentine"" gift exchange and then used the afternoon to catch up on scientific analysis of samples collected over the week’s EVAs so far. Towards the evening, the crew gathered in the upstairs common area of the Hab to prepare reports for the communications window, share stories, and discuss what would be prepared for dinner. After the communications window, the crew will eat chicken and rice casserole, discuss tomorrow’s priorities of work, and then play some card games before bed.Look Ahead Plan: Due to today’s ongoing inclement weather, the ground tomorrow will be too saturated to make EVAs practical. Instead, the crew will remain at the Hab to focus on refining research, improving ongoing investigations, and drafting procedural documents to improve the workflow of future crews. The inability to conduct EVAs can be frustrating, but having multiple crew members with culinary skills makes being stuck at the Hab much more palatible. Tomorrow will also see another rotation of Commander and Executive Officer, so a new day will bring new leadership.Anomalies in work: EVA# 07 terminated early due to weatherWeather: Cloudy all day long, rain started after 1100 hrs, with consistent rain all afternoon and into the eveningCrew Physical Status: NominalEVA:EVA#07: 0518800/4250900 (Pooh’s Corner), 0518600/4251500 (North Ridge, not reached)Reports to be filed: Sol Summary, EVA report, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, Journalist Report"
crew 205 - 13/02/2019," We woke up with the smell of home-made brownies and coffee. The first EVA left at 10.00 am driving Curiosity and Opportunity rovers heading to Candor Chasma. The team collected excellent geological samples and had the chance to explore the area. Meanwhile, at the Hab, the team worked on new maintenance tasks. We checked the status of the EVA suits making sure they are fully operational. Batteries were replaced in those suits not working properly, making them now ready to be used. At the return of the EVA team, all the crew enjoyed together some Martian pasta with dried tomato and chicken sauce. In the afternoon, the second EVA team headed to explore the area surrounding the Hab.The plan was to test Crew 205’s drone, collect samples and conduct photography. However, the Martian weather complicated the task. Winds were too strong to fly the drone. The team continued nonetheless, with its plans of climbing the Old Repeater Point. The view of MDRS was great from there! However, in the field, the rain started to hit and the space helmets started to become foggy. Walking on the hilly surface in such conditions was not easy. The team then decided to head back to the Hab, enjoy a warm coffee and tea, and continue working there. Tonight we plan movie night … maybe “The Martian”?;))Look Ahead Plan: Most of the day tomorrow will be dedicated to working “from home” on the different projects. After a few days on Mars, we have started collecting many pieces of great science and data which need to be analyzed. A team will also head the Old Repeater Point and North Ridge for a short test the drone (if the weather permits), continuing with the initial plan of today.Tomorrow is also Saint Valentine’s day so we plan a special evening and dinner with “Secret Valentine” presents included. In addition, it will be the first day we start rotating roles in the crew. The members in the position of commander and XO will be rotating for the next week.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Cloudy all day long, windy with light rain in the afternoonCrew Physical Status: NominalEVA:EVA#05: 0520300/4241100 (Candor Chasma)EVA#06: 4250900/517950 (Old Repeater Point), 4251500/518600 (North Ridge, not reached)Reports to be filed: Sol Summary, EVA report, EVA request, Operations Report, HSO Report, Astronomy Report, Science Report, Greenhab Report, Journalist Report"
crew 205 - 12/02/2019," We started the day with what is becoming our daily routine: waking up at 7 am, having coffee and breakfast together and by 8.30 am start our work. In the morning, the first EVA team set off on rovers Spirit and Opportunity Northwards on Cow Dung Road towards the “Moon” areas. They passed Galileo road (losing contact with MDRS as expected shortly after). Before reaching Cowboy Corner, Spirit reported having 75% SOC, Spirit’s battery reduced rapidly and the rovers were stopped between Tank Wash and White Moon with Spirit on 63% and Opportunity at 75%. The EVA was modified to be completed on foot by only visiting, exploring and sampling areas within White Moon and the easternmost fringes of Beige Moon. The turnings of the road that enter to the Moon were recorded on GPS for future use in EVAs. Some excellent samples of quartz and sulphur containing deposits were collected and will be analysed in the coming days before being described fully in the upcoming Science Report. Meanwhile, in the Hab, the rest of the team continue working in the GreenHab daily duties, EVA planning and astronomy projects. Lunch was ready for the returning EVA team and the crew ate together in good spirits.Equipment was prepared for use in the second EVA of the day, including a drone with a vertical camera and the ability to connect to a laptop for images to be reviewed in the field. As planned, the EVA team started getting prepared for its mission to North Ridge. However, while preparing, it was found that some of the suits were not fully functional and others, were still charging from the EVA in the morning. The team initially thought only of the suits was to be fully charged and operational. For this reason, putting the safety of the crew as the top priority, the commander took the decision to cancel the EVA. After the fact, it was found that a second spacesuit was also fully charged. All crew members thus, stayed in the Hab working “from home” in their different duties and projects. Tonight, following our daily crew meeting, we plan to enjoy a “Martian-Spanish” tapas dinner.Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow we plan to continue with the initial plan of today. A first EVA team will head in the morning will head to Maxwell Montes. A second team will head the Old Repeater Point and North Ridge to test the drone.

crew 205 - 11/02/2019," Today was the first day of sim. We woke up looking at the snowy Martian landscape from our small windows in the Hab. Slowly, we are adapting to the life here. We are getting familiar with our new home and our new crew family. We began the day by removing the snow from the ground in the tunnels and enjoying breakfast all together. Today we had the opportunity to experience our first EVAs. The snow however, introduced some changes to our initial plans. The first EVA team scheduled in the morning, originally planning to reach the White Moon area, was redirected to Kissing Camel Ridge. The team conducted some sample collection and explored the area. The second EVA team in the afternoon headed to North Ridge. Due to the hot weather, the team came back earlier than expected. We learned the challenges of moving around with the spacesuit under the “Martian” sun. Meanwhile, we started our project on food production in regolith; although it was challenged with some issues with the autoclave. We harvested some of the carrots from the GreenHab. We also performed our first astronomical observation (we expect to download the data later today).In the evening, we did inventory of the food that we received today (shipped form “Earth”), arranged the kitchen and held our daily crew meeting. Tonight, a nice dinner including those Martian harvested carrots is waiting for us!Looking Ahead Plan: Tomorrow we plan to also conduct two EVAs following the original plans scheduled for today: one team will head to The Moon area; the second team will head to North Ridge. We will test the drones for our EVA navigation projects, continue regolith sample collections, and continue working on the other research projects and duties (including photometry astronomical analysis, GreenHab and outreach activities).Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Light snow on the ground in the morning.

crew 205 - 10/02/2019," Today was a special day: the first day we woke up at the Hab! We spent the night together with Crew 204. The place was crowded but we had a great evening conversing and playing board games together.We woke up full of energy and ready to prepare the final details for our mission. In the morning, we got our first pictures as a crew and proceeded execute crew handover with Crew 204. We came back to the Hab and settled in to our new home for the next two weeks. We enjoyed blueberry pancakes for breakfast, unpacked our bags, did some deep cleaning, took inventory, and loaded the water tanks.In the afternoon, Atila and David joined us at the Hab to conduct training on mission protocols and operations. Then we split into two groups for EVA training using the rovers in the field. Finally, we practiced putting on the suits and using the earpieces.Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow we enter sim. We will start our new daily routine and plan to conduct our first EVAs. Stay tuned for our future reports. We have two weeks of full of exciting projects coming up!

crew 204 - 09/02/2019," The time has come for crew 204 to return home. There are mixed feelings in the mind of the crew members. It was a roller coaster ride but ended quite successfully. The crew woke up a bit later than usual, the last warm Martian breakfast with a sip of Coffee. The first thing on the list for the crew was to clean, clean and clean, the Hab as well as all the operation places. Post cleaning was the wait for the upcoming new crew. We were pretty excited to meet the International Emerging Space Leaders Crew (Crew 205). Finally, the wait was over. At noon our Martian family expanded. After the introductions and enjoying lunch together, our crew got to train them on all the basics to survive and efficiently operate around the Hab. The crew 204 handed over the Hab responsibilities to the new crew. Post training, both crews enjoyed burgers together in Hanksville. The crew 205 is an interdisciplinary team, full of enthusiasm and new exciting projects coming up.Look Ahead Plan: The crew 204 is scheduled to deorbit around 0800 hours and reach Grand Junction for rendezvous with the spacecraft, moving forward to reenter home sweet home.Anomalies in work: None EncounteredWeather: SunnyCrew Physical Status: NominalEVA’s location: NoneReports to be file: 1) Operations Report 2) Green Hab Report 3) Commander Report 4) Photos"

Was it something changing?Yes, of course not a life changing one but surely a lesson to live on limited water, food supply and strict protocols.Experiencing some percentage of daily life of Astronauts. The first thing which the crew realized after waking up is the final day of the sim.The crew had the morning breakfast and were in a rush for their morning EVA, Carbon Flight and MarsBag went for EVA while Cosmos and SpaceBot were in their daily Hab activities. Today’s in charge for cooking was SpaceBot, Post EVA, the crew had lunch together with challenges of Sim as a discussion topic. Today there were 2 EVA’s, one in the morning while the second after lunch. This time, it was SpaceBot and Cosmos turn for the EVA. While other crew members rested for a while at the Hab. Green Positive vibes all over the Green Hab. It’s sad that the crew won’t be able to see the growth of their planted seeds. This is the Ending and probably the last Sol Summary.Look Ahead Plan: The crew has planned to clean the entire facility from top to bottom, from right to left.

crew 204 - 07/02/2019," What gives an excitation? A rover working from ~ 13000 km with live Audio/Video stream via rover will surely create one. Today was the judgment day for the child rover project. The crew woke up earlier than their assigned schedule, potato creamy soup is a good start of the day. The crew was on the run as the EVA was requested post breakfast.SpaceBot and MarsBag carried out the walking EVA near the MDRS HAB premises. The main purpose of the EVA was to operate child rover from a remote location, India (13000 kms away). It was operated by students of Sipna College of Engineering. The demonstration was successful in exploring the Martian soil. The crew was happy as their project was a success. Still needs upgradation for sure.Post EVA, the team discussed about the rover and Indian Mythology. Pre-Lunch, the crew members were on their assigned respective task. Lunch was prepared by CarbonFlight and SpaceBot, quite a lot food which will be used for dinner as well.Post lunch, all crew members rested for a while. Carbon flight printed few bricksfor Martian habitat from his 3D Clay Printer a day ago and now they are dried and ready to be baked. There is a positive vibe from the Green Hab, every-day you eager to go to the GreenHab just to see the growth of the plants. The crew is still planning for some board gamespost dinner.Look Ahead Plan: The 3D clay printer has printed some bricks out of Martian soil composition which will be baked to test the inner dynamic structure and possibility to use the brick for future habitat.

crew 204 - 04/02/2019," The most selfless living things are the plants. They just believe in giving essentials. For any interplanetary travel or living on other planet. They are the critical part of the life support system. They provide food, water, and oxygen, which are one of the essentials to sustain our self. Maintaining the Green Hab is a big task and an important one.The crew woke up little late as EVA was cancelled due to strong winds. The roaring gust, the strong winds striking the hab is the only sound the crew is listening from last day on repeat mode. Sipping of Hot Chocolate and discussion over Veganism, MDRS Green Hab, Growing of Herbs via Aquaponic system escalated by an hour. The crew had brunch on Monday morning which is quiet a strange thing but its Mars! Anything, Anytime. The lunch was cooked earlier by Space Bot and Carbon flight as per the rotation while the other members cleaned the kitchen. The crew is facing some internet issues from last day which can be due to the weather but not a big problem.Post lunch the crew started to work on their assigned projects. All the rover issues were solved, and the bot is ready to test offside with streamed AV. While Crew Commander, Crew Health and Safety Officer (Mars Bag) which were assisted by the Green Hab Officer (Cosmos) looking after old plants as well observing the new plants which were sowed recently in 8 different soil compositions.A positive news from the Green Hab, the newly planted seeds are coming to life. The EVA was cancelled due to windy conditions, so its time was utilized for recreational activities. The crew has planned to watch a movie post dinner.Look Ahead Plan: The 3D clay printer will be tested manually using different soil composition and printing some samples. The work on the child rover will be to test the complete system outdoor during a short EVA.Finger crossed on weather and servers. The sprouts and mix seeds have already started showing good results.

crew 204 - 03/02/2019," Nature itself is a super power no one can or will be able to control it. Mission Support! We have a problem, Strong winds incoming! The EVA was proposed to Mission Support last night but after their guidance it was cancelled. The crew woke up little late than decided as it was Sunday, started the morning with warm cup of soup and salty crackers with a round table discussion over the usage of water on Earth, Mars and ISS. Post breakfast the crew engineer (Space Bot) started to work on his child rover’s project. The rover had some serious problems with its circuitry which was found out this morning and was resolved at the earliest. The battery check and camera test (A/V) was done inside the RAMM. While Crew Commander (Carbon Flight) was busy working on his 3D clay printer. The printer was integrated with its extruder as a clay syringe. The printer was mounted on the wooden log to support the system. Delicious Sunday lunch was cooked by Crew Health and Safety Officer (Mars Bag) which was assisted by the Green Hab Officer (Cosmos). He was into his daily assigned Green Hab activities looking after old plants as well observing the new plants which were sowed recently in 8 different soil compositions. Post lunch, the crew spent some time watching movie and relaxing their noon. The EVA was cancelled due to windy conditions, so its time was utilized for recreational activities. The crew has planned to play some card and board games post Sunday dinner.Look Ahead Plan: The 3D clay printer will be tested using a simulant soil and later with different composition, proceeding printing manually on usual basis. The work on the child rover will be to test the complete system outdoor. Finger crossed on weather and servers. The child-rover will be operated for future EVA’s.

They are not the living things but does the work better than the living beings. The crew woke up as per the schedule assigned earlier, concluding the morning activities and breakfast with a round table discussion over today’s individual task. The crew engineer (Space Bot) started to work on his child rover’s project. The rover was dis-integrated for system check at the RAMM operations and was again assembled, integrated and tested by generating a local server. The quick test was done during the EVA. While Crew Commander (Carbon Flight) was busy working on his 3D clay printer. The printer was assembled, and Arduino was programmed but integration is yet to be done. The project was assisted by Crew Health and Safety Officer (Mars Bag). The GreenHab Officer (Cosmos) was into his daily assigned Green Hab activities. Lunch (Red Kidney beans with rice) was prepared by Cosmos after his routine Green Hab activites. Later, the crew initiated the PreEVA procedures. The EVA was carried by Cosmos and SpaceBot, the purpose of EVA was to test the child rover and Martian Photography via child rover (which was not successful). Post EVA the team started preparing for Dinner prior to the Sunset, opening the floor for personal opinions, suggestions and recreational activites.Look Ahead Plan: The 3D clay printer will be integrated by next day, proceeding with testing and printing manually out of different soil samples. The work on the child rover will be to check the Audio/Video system plus checking the battery life for further operations. The child-rover will be operated for future EVA’s.

We have requested prior 2 EVA’s onein the morning and later by evening. Our 1st EVA was delayed andrescheduled due to limited water tank issue which was resolved at theearliest. The crew members initiated their project work along withtheir Hab responsibilities. Post Lunch we were surprised and glad tomeet the Nat Geo Photographer Jad Davenport who came to visit thefacility for reporting and clicking wonderful photos with the crew. Wehad our 1st EVA by 1400 and later 2nd by 1500, we were followed by theenthusiastic photographer to capture our EVA activities as well as ourmoments via his personal camera and his drone. It was a hush and rush day but went well with no setbacks.Look Ahead Plan: We are going to follow up on our EVA plans as pertoday’s investigation and exploration. We got some soil samples during our 2nd EVA which we need to mesh and set some composition parameters for Martian 3D Printer.

crew 203 - 26/01/2019," Our last day on the station began by a simple cereal breakfast. Then everyone took off to finish some of the experiments, and also to start organizing the station for the next crew to take over it. We had lunch, and a much-desired bath, then we headed for Hanksville for our first dinner on Earth. We can’t believe how fast time passed. We’ll probably go to bed early, leave everything as packed as possible, and get ready for our return to Earth. As of Comms window, we’re still waiting for crew 204 to arrive.Look Ahead Plan: We’re leaving the station tomorrow morning.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Sunny with some clouds, low intensity to no winds.Crew Physical Status: In good health.EVA: None.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, Journalist Report, Science Report, HSO Report, Mission Summary."
crew 203 - 25/01/2019," We woke up knowing that it was going to be a special day. Our last day on Mars. Some results from the research were still to be taken, so after breakfast (some leftovers from yesterday’s dinner), everyone took off to work. We had lunch together and decided to break sim just after it. We went to the airlock, went out together, and with that, finished our simulation.The crew took a small stroll around the hab, feeling the air again. Two crewmembers went then to Hanksville for a water run, while the rest stayed in the station to keep working on the projects. I prepared an ""Arroz Chaufa"" (the Martian version of it), which is a Peruvian dish, for Atila, who will share dinner with us tonight.Look Ahead Plan: We expect to finish up the activities tomorrow morning, get the hab ready for the checkout, and get ready to receive crew 204.

As always, we started the day with a big breakfast, those powdered eggs are starting to taste good, and supplies will last perfectly until our last meal on Mars. We got ready for our last EVA of the mission, and while we traversed the hab ridge, the crewmembers on the station were working on the final touches of their research. We came back to a plentiful lunch, and the afternoon was spent in more research. We expect to watch the sky tonight, as we get ready to say goodbye to the pale red dot, our home, our present, and hopefully, our future.Look Ahead Plan: We have two days left here on Mars. After almost two wonderful and demanding weeks, we’re almost ready to come back to Earth. There are some final results to take from the research, finalize the global reports, and bring the mission to a close.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Clear skies all day long, low to moderate intensity winds.Crew Physical Status: In good health, in better shape than yesterday…!EVA: 1, a team of 4 went to the Hab Ridge.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, Journalist Report, EVA Report, HSO Report, Astronomy Report."
crew 203 - 23/01/2019," We started our day as usual with a big breakfast, pancakes, and coffee. Some of our crewmembers, who were scheduled to go on EVA reported not so optimal health status, so we shifted the EVA team. The team got ready and went to the south of the hab, to find a zone filled with evidence of ancient life. While the team that remained in the hab performed some station keeping labors, as well as science. The crew rested in the afternoon after lunch and got ready for reporting. We’ll most likely go early to bed.Look Ahead Plan: We’re planning for a couple more EVAs during the mission, and to review some of the results on the research.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Clear skies all day long, low-intensity winds.Crew Physical Status: One crewmember might have had a fever due to a cold, other reported a headache, and another, muscular pain.

crew 203 - 22/01/2019," The day began with the long expected visit of Sole Moller and Noel Spirandelli, Journalist and Photographer respectively, who came to document our life on the red planet. We had breakfast before they arrived, greeted them with some coffee and then we began a tour of the station. We then got ready for a short EVA, that took us to a wonderful location, really close to the hab, the Hab Ridge, (So, if you are reading this, I STRONGLY recommend to go there in one of the EVAs). We spend our time doing some recognition of the zone, telling them about the science that is done, and keeping up with our lives on the station. We had a martian lunch with them, and after finishing what was left of the station to be seen, they returned to Earth, and we returned to our mission. We’ll hopefully have at last the movie night Morpheus hasn’t let us have.Look Ahead Plan: We’re expecting to review some unexpected results on some experiments, to continue with the science, and to do more EVAs to the amazing places we are surrounded by.

crew 203 - 20/01/2019," Today we partly let some leisure activities take some of our time. Resting is important to keep the creativity up…! Although we are physically a bit tired, our mood is still up. We had a bean lunch, cooked as traditionally as possible with what’s available. After lunch, I gave the crew members some letters from their families I had brought with me from Earth, there was a lot of emotion and happiness. We spent the afternoon listening to some music, solving a puzzle, talking, and also preparing some reports. We’ll have dinner and then we’ll try to watch the eclipse, if clouds have mercy on us.Look Ahead Plan: We’ll have a week full of EVAs, as well as the first results from the projects.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Partly cloudy skies, cirrus and cirrostratus.Crew Physical Status: In good health.EVA: noneReports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, Journalist Report, EVA Request, Science Report."

crew 203 - 18/01/2019," It was a late start of the day. As if we had agreed on it, all the crew went up at almost exactly the same time. Last night we had an anomaly with the diesel generator which forced us to enter low consumption mode, and to start the morning in the same way. We had our breakfast, then each one was headed for their respective zone, it’s curious how now everyone has their own spot they can feel as their own. We had a tropical lunch based on coconut and pineapple, and kept working on keeping the station and projects. The sunset brought everyone back to the hab, we shared freshly baked oatmeal cookies, and are headed to a pizza once the capcom window is closed. (how curious, the narrative line was all about food)Look Ahead Plan: We’re close to the middle of our mission, we want to keep working on each project, and to do some more EVAs.Anomalies in work: We went on low consumption mode during the night and morning due to a malfunction of the diesel generator.Weather: Clear skies all day long, with moderate winds.Crew Physical Status: In good health, although tiredness is starting to catch up.EVA: NoneReports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, Journalist Report, EVA Request, Astronomy Report."
crew 203 - 17/01/2019," We entered the second quarter of our mission, a time where routine kicks in (if there is such a thing as routine on Mars). Everyone seemed a little bit tired this morning, but nothing some food and a conversation couldn’t fix. Everyone reviewed their respective projects and systems, had lunch, and then the EVA team started to prepare for our afternoon on the beautiful plains of Mars. The work was amazing, a lot of geology was done, a little sightseeing too. Sometimes inside the hab it’s easy to forget how beautiful Mars is. We were received by some delicious eggs and Tang, talked about the future, and now we’re waiting for another night of laughter, fun, and some sleep. The thought of just having heard the team voices for a few days now just came to our minds, and it’s somehow mindblowing.Look Ahead Plan: Keep the hard work going…! the nice food being prepared…! the laughter and the bonding…! and make it so that this is just the first step in a long way to go…!Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Cloudy in the morning (Cumulus), with the presence of Nimbostratus, but no precipitation, near the sunset it was less cloudy.

crew 203 - 16/01/2019," I’m starting a routine of a morning complete inspection of the facilities; this lets me plan the day better. We woke up to a layer of snow outside the Hab, after breakfast, and a small workout session of three crewmembers, we proceeded to remove the snow from the Hab areas covered by it.After that, each crewmember started working on their respective projects, getting everything ready for an exciting rest of mission filled with science, and probably also a little bit of fun. We had a vegetarian lunch, a nod to our XO, and kept working. We’ve still had time to laugh and bond.A light dinner and an early sleep will close the day, and be the preamble for what’s to come.Look Ahead Plan: Science is looking good.

We had our pictures taken, did a small change of command ""ceremony"", and then departed to a dinosaur walk, guided by director Shannon. We waved goodbye as the crew departed, and then started organizing groceries and rooms.Today we finished the water runs, and should be ready for the entire length of the mission. We started our training with Atila, being it the first time it’s done in Spanish. We also were able to share breakfast and lunch, which I was able to cook (I love cooking on Mars). Finally, our remote astronomer did an amazing observation of M31, which we will share.Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow crew 203 will send the Mission Plan, along with the initial HSO report, and biographies with official pictures.

crew 202 - 10/01/2019," this morning after breakfast we had visitors from our pale blue dot. A few guests visited us, to learn about our research projects and the importance of analog missions for the exploration of Mars. The crew followed us during our work, in our daily life, and in our EVA. Due to the footage of our work at MDRS, the EVA started later than planned. Meeting earthlings was a little anticipation of the experience we will have once back on Earth. Until this visit, we did not fully realize how isolated we have been. After sharing some of our daily routine with our guest, we went back to our life as Martians, and spent the afternoon working and cleaning the habitat.Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow we will have one last, short EVA to walking distance from the habitat, to pick the last geological samples. We will also wrap up our research projects, clean the whole campus, and prepare to meet crew 203Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Sunny and warmCrew Physical Status: In good healthEVA: The Commander, Executive Officer, Crew Journalist, Health and Safety Officer, and one guest had an EVA in the area west of the intersection of Cow Dung Rd and Galileo RdReports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, EVA report, EVA request, Astronomy Report, Journalist Report"
crew 202 - 09/01/2019," this morning had a session of stretching for the back and shoulders. After breakfast, four crew members went on EVA towards Lith Canyon. Due to the safety protocol concerning the battery charge status of the rover, the crew walked the final part of the road, about 0.8 miles, to the west entrance of Lith Canyon. Walking around the special region (and “beyond the dinosaurs”), the crew studied the features of Lith Canyon from the northwestern wall. The condition of the west entrance did not allow the crew to hike down into the canyon.After collecting radiometric data, the EVA crew walked back to the rover and drove the long road to the habitat, to join the remaining crew.The afternoon was spent working, cleaning, making pizza dough, and resting. Tonight we are preparing a pizza and board games night.Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow we will host a CBS crew that will grab footage of our work here.

crew 202 - 08/01/2019," While our return to Earth is getting closer, the crew is in full activity with the final part of their data collection and research project.Sol Activity Summary: this morning started with yoga and meditation, in view of a long EVA. After breakfast, due to the current conditions of the road and to the intended destination of the proposed EVA, the crew worked out the details of the EVA with the Program Director and Assistant Program Director. After receiving the ""go, but be careful"", three crew members departed on their ATV. I have never visited the Skyline Rim region, after giving up my place to a crew mate last year and have been craving this excursion into the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary for a long time. Unfortunately, even this year I was not able to reach the area (already planning for next year. Third is the charm, right?), after encountering a thick layer of mud along Copernicus Hwy 1574 south and deciding to abort the primary destination out of safety concerns. The ATV would probably have made it, but the risk of getting stuck due to muddy tires was a possibility, and since these layers have been there for 145 million years, there is a good chance that they will be there next time I am around! The EVA had a few intermediate stops on the way back home. In the meanwhile, the crew members in the habitat swept the science dome for the fourth time in the mission and began a deep cleaning of both the lower and the upper deck of the habitat. Luckily, the EVA crew managed to scrape most of the thick chunks of mud from their boots, and to clean their EVA suits and flight suits without destroying the great job made by the rest of the crew. After an afternoon of work and some rest, we are now ready for a relaxed evening.Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow we will attempt an EVA in the area of Lith Canyon, pending condition of the area and behavior of rover batteries (they performed well since the temperature increased)Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Sunny and warmer, snow almost completely meltedCrew Physical Status: Tired and in good healthEVA: The Commander, Crew Geologist, and Crew Journalist rode the ATVs towards Skyline Rim, but turned around short of the final destination due to excessive amount of mud on the road.

crew 202 - 07/01/2019," Second week is proceeding according to plans, all research projects working as expected, with much data collected and some more work to do once back on EarthSol Activity Summary: After a cookies and movie night yesterday, strong wind caused a noisy night in the habitat, but the morning routine of stretching got all of us ready to go as usual. In the morning and early afternoon, three crew members performed a long EVA, while the crew astronomer worked in the Musk solar observatory and the crew geologist sorted and analyze the rocks collected in the last few days. The late afternoon and evening were also spent in working on research projects.At the beginning of this week, a though begins to crawl in: we will be back on Earth and outside this habitat at the end of the week. However, there is still much more to do, and while we think of home, school, work, and ice cream, we are still Martians, ready to put our effort into the research we are doing and into the many daily activities that keep our habitat up and running.Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow we will have an EVA towards Skylim Rim to study and collect samples from the Mancos shale layerAnomalies in work: NoneWeather: Windy and sunny, with snow melting and muddy trailsCrew Physical Status: The expected amount of tiredness, but morning routines is helping with any sorenessEVA: The Executive Officer, Crew Engineer, and Health and Safety Officer had an EVA to Cactus Road and the Canyon area, where they collected samples for the crew geologist and measurements of radiationReports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, EVA report, EVA request, Astronomy Report, Journalist Report"
crew 202 - 05/01/2019," We are now half-way through our mission, and enjoying the warm habitat while expecting more snow overnightSol Activity Summary: To help recovering from the toughness of Mars, this morning we opted for yoga and guided meditation for our morning routine. Following the warmest EVA of the mission (temperatures still around freezing, but bright sun), today we had the coldest EVA of the mission, due to cloudy sky and cold wind. The EVA was intended to reach the areas of canyons at the end of Cactus Rd, but the snow made it difficult to recognize the trail in certain areas, so the EVA crew stopped along the way to work on their research project. After a hot lunch, the afternoon was spent watching a movie, working, and resting.Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow we will have a short EVA if precipitation ends and conditions are acceptable. Mostly, we will enjoy a day indoor.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Cloudy, expecting snow tonight and tomorrow morningCrew Physical Status: Some tiredness here and there, but generally very goodEVA: The Commander, Executive Officer, Crew Geologist, and Crew Engineer had an EVA to the East, along Galileo Rd and the initial part of Cactus Rd. Condition of the trail did not allow to go all the way to the canyons region (snow made it very hard to discern the trail, and the Commander decided to stop in a region of interest along the way).Reports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, EVA report, EVA request, Astronomy Report, Journalist Report"
crew 202 - 06/01/2019," Despite waking up to a white Mars again, the mission is proceeding very well, and we also managed to have a short EVASol Activity Summary: Today, Sunday on Earth, the sol started a little slow. We woke up 30 minutes later than the usual schedule and had some great stretching. After sweeping the tunnels and enjoying some personal time, we had a short EVA to gather measurements on radiation. Two crew members took a shower today. The struggle with alternating icy cold and scalding hot water is real, but the aftermath is amazing! The tired crew enjoyed a relaxed afternoon, thinking of students at Purdue who will start their classes tomorrowLook Ahead Plan: Tomorrow we will try again to have an EVA towards the canyon areaAnomalies in work: NoneWeather: Sunny and warmerCrew Physical Status: Two crew member are in perfect mood after the shower, four more crew members are doing goodEVA: The Executive Officer, Journalist, and Health and Safety Officer had an EVA along Galileo Rd and to Marble RitualReports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, EVA report, EVA request, Journalist Report"
crew 202 - 04/01/2019," All projects are moving forward, with some ups and downs. We are collecting plenty of data, and each of us is giving much contribution, both with our own research projects and as test subjects for our crewmates.Sol Activity Summary: Our morning routine continues to be a varying mix of useful stretching and conditioning exercises. Today the crew members who stayed in the habitat yesterday went on EVA and vice versa. The physical and mental stress of the mission is beginning to creep through, but the crew is reacting very well. Time is flying, and it is already Sol 6 of our mission, we now feel this is ""our"" place, that we live in and that we take care of. It is a great view when coming back from EVA. The crew keeps having a great time together: before each EVA, the whole crew is involved in the preparation, and those who stay in the habitat are always ready to welcome the EVA crew with some hot meal. After the usual afternoon of rest and work on the projects, the crew is preparing for the evening (yesterday we had a movie night).Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow we will have a geology EVA towards canyons, pending advice on practicability of roads.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Still cold but getting warmer. Some snow on the ground and on the north face of hills.Crew Physical Status: Exercises and much work are giving us health and some soreness. Morale is high!EVA: The Commander, Health and Safety Officer, and Crew Geologist had an EVA to Greenstone Rd and to the region North of Kissing Camel Range, to collect sand and shale samples.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, EVA report, EVA request, Astronomy Report, Journalist Report"
crew 202 - 03/01/2019," The crew is continuing work on all research project. The morning was spent in power conservation mode, during which half of the crew performed an EVA and the other half stayed in the habitat to work on various projects. The power is now nominal.Sol Activity Summary: After a good morning stretching and some light exercises, half of the crew went on EVA #4 while the rest worked on projects (and some origami) in the habitat. The afternoon was spent resting and working on research projects, including microbiology, geology, and astronomy. The crew is doing great, and every little difficulty or tiredness is overcome with laughter and a cohesion among crew members which is a joy to the eyes!Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow we will have a geology EVA in areas of sand dunes and continue our projects.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: Sunny and cold with melting snow on the groundCrew Physical Status: In perfect healthEVA: The Executive Officer, Crew Engineer, and Crew Journalist had an EVA to the region North of Kissing Camel Range, to collect clay and shale samples and identify sandy regions.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, EVA report, EVA request, Geology Report, Journalist Report"
crew 202 - 02/01/2019," Today we began our real exploration, with the first medium-length EVA. The EVA supported geology and two more research projects. The mission is proceeding greatly, with a great combination of work, exploration, fun, and enjoyment of life together on Mars.Sol Activity Summary: The day began on a stress-relieving note, with some yoga small exercises and postures led by the Commander. After breakfast with crepes and Nutella, the whole crew participated in the preparation of EVA #3, which lasted 2 hours and 45 minutes. The afternoon was spent resting and working on research projects. After sunset, the crew had a little scare due to some malfunction in the power system, which was luckily solved in a short time by the Program Director.My commander role keeps giving me emotional moments very often. Once again, it is amazing to receive twice as much good vibes, from my own experience, and from seeing the joy and happiness of my crew. Today the EVA was exhausting as usual but full of laughter, and the work becomes incredibly light when friends are around, and good feelings are within us. We are having our first emergency tonight, with the power system being a little mercurial (on Mars?), and we are currently in power conservation mode, but with the mood still very high!!  Any non-nominal situation is more learning on our way to Mars!!Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow we will have a second EVA for a collection of geological samples and support to phase 2 of the research project on crew stress (after completion of the EVA). Crew members in the habitat will work on their projects, besides dealing with the daily maintenanceAnomalies in work: The generator is currently off, campus in conservation modeWeather: Sunny and cold with melting snow on the groundCrew Physical Status: In perfect health, helped by the morning yoga. Some expected muscle soreness for the EVA crewEVA: The Commander, Executive Officer, Crew Engineer, and Crew Journalist had an EVA to the region along Pleiades Rd, after riding the rovers along Cow Dung Rd. The snow is finally melting, and the fluvial deposit area around Pleiades Rd only had 1 inch of patchy snow, which did not cause any hazard, while the hills on the sides of the road were completely uncovered and yielded interesting clay samples. On the way out, scenarios were discussed for the project on EVA decision-making. While in the field, we worked on geology and on radiation measurement. The EVA had a long time in the field, between hiking and working, and was a great experience of the toughness of outdoor operations on Mars.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, EVA report, EVA request, Journalist Report"
crew 202 - 31/12/2018," The crew is now in full simulation. We are on Mars, though it looks like we landed somewhere close to the polar cap!Sol Activity Summary: What an exciting day here! We woke up to an unexpected 2 inches of fresh snow, in a winter wonderland. Since we still had to complete our training with Rover driving and EVA suits training, we were not in simulation yet, so we could sweep and shovel the tunnels, the front porch, and the solar panels without wearing suits. The Rover training got all of us slightly cold, so we decided to get back in the habitat and enjoy some hot chicken noodle soup before completing the training. In the afternoon, we finally celebrated the beginning of our simulation, which started immediately with two short EVAs that gave every crew member a chance to experience how driving and hiking in a heavy suit feels.What a great feeling for me to be back into my space suit. I am also lucky because the two-piece suit fits me perfectly! But the top for me today was to look at my crew mates during the airlock pressurization, and outside in the field: in their eyes and their enthusiasm I saw a reflection not only of me last year, during my first experience in EVA, but also the same joy that I feel this year. It is good to be here, and it is great to see a completely different face of Mars, an icy and snowy face. But the cold did not stop us, each member of the crew has aspirations to go to space or to help our effort to reach Mars, and some discomfort is a small price to pay in exchange for being a part of this!Look Ahead Plan: Due to the large amount of snow, we will not attempt any EVA tomorrow (except for engineering EVA to keep our front porch clean of snow), and we will spend an amazing New Year’s Day getting to explore our home for the next two weeks. We will start a few outreach and crew conditioning projects, and enjoy the day on Mars!Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: cold, with some snow precipitation during the dayCrew Physical Status: In perfect health, and all EVA-testedEVA: Two short EVAs to Marble Ritual, to get the crew used to EVA protocols, communication protocols, and the joys and pains of activity in a space suit.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Greenhab Report, Two EVA Reports, Journalist Report"
crew 202 - 30/12/2018," The crew is almost on Mars, ready to begin their isolated life in the most amazing habitat in the world. Oh, wait, outside of this world!! Destination: Mars.Sol Activity Summary: Today five excited earthlings and one ""slightly more experienced"" half-Martian learned a little bit about life on Mars. A few fixes to the extension cords that power the water tank were followed by a mix of chores in the habitat, setting up rooms, sorting food, and replenishing our water supply. The late afternoon has been occupied with fixing the automatic observatory, and with the first part of crew training.It is hard to find words to describe the feeling of being ""at home"" again, and how great it is to discover I am still amazed at everything around me. It is really hard to refrain myself from pouring into my crew a lot of stories from my past experience. I do not want to spoil any surprise for them, and I wish they will meet the same challenges and the same prizes I had last year. The entire crew knows how great an opportunity this is and is ready to take advantage of every moment of it, the funny and the tough ones! We already had hard work, and we already had funny moments and plenty of laughter with the program director and the assistant program director! Before we even lock the door of our habitat, I can tell I am home again!Look Ahead Plan: EVA and Rover training tomorrow morning will be followed by beginning of simulation, and two very short EVAs to give all the crew a chance to try the experience and discomfort of EVAs in a hostile environment that requires the use of space suits and air packs. And for New Year’s Eve Dinner, a few visitors from Earth are expected!!Anomalies in work: Slight delay in training due to many trips necessary to refill water tanks.

crew 193 - 01/05/2018," The day started off later than usual as the EVA-16 team opted to delay their morning excursion until 0900 in the face of threatening storm clouds to the South and East. The morning EVA then progressed as expected, with the PM team keeping up with usual Hab operations, cleaning schedules, GreenHab upkeep and data collection in the interim. Lunch was a Martian feast of curried kidney beans and brown rice (so much better than chianti and fava beans). The EVA-17 team left shortly thereafter to scout the area just west of Zubrin’s head, wisely choosing to turn back 90min ahead of schedule in anticipation of the weather, luckily only meeting with Martian rain for a slight period at the tail end of their sojourn. The crew astronomer managed to capture one solar prominence and a filament. Hab operations otherwise continued as per usual, with one brave crew member opting to try waterless shampoo, and photo-documenting the results (spoiler alert: said crew member still has all her hair).Look Ahead Plan: EVA 18 will consist of a Green Valley and Mid-Ridge Planitia exploration, whereas EVA 19 will take up an excursion just Southwest of Kissing Camels Ridge. The team continues to function well under the guidance of the dear Commander. Crew development and team-building will continue by way of ASL, team stories, movies and a good ol’ fashioned round of Shanghai, although to be fair, the latter is probably more likely to result in team-breaking than anything else.Anomalies in work:1. The crew astronomer was accidentally locked out for a brief spell, but was let in after pleading his case by way of loud noises, and harbors no grudges (we hope).Weather: Overcast in the AM, rainy and gusty (a Mars-nado, really) in the PM, resulting in a premature return to base on PM EVA.Crew Physical Status: ""So good it hurts,"" as per one team member.EVA: EVA-16 proceeded with an exploration of Lith Canyon to the North, and accrued the usual data regarding emergency shelters and crew comfort, safety, health and well-being. Similarly, EVA-17 proceeded with an exploration just West of Zubrin’s Head, and accrued the same data regarding shelters and crew well-being.

While EVA 14 was occurring, the two crew members in the hab took care of the plants in the green Hab and cleaned the shared living area in the main Hab. One crew member credits the growth of the plants to the time she spends talking to them. Maybe Mark Watney should have tried that!The crew lunched together (thanks again to our commander for cooking), had a short meeting to continue team development and then it was time to get ready for EVA 15. EVA 15 was cut short at 1800 due to approaching rain clouds. The EVA was in the Candor Chasma area and it was decided that if it rained it would be a very difficult area to exit and return to the Hab.Look Ahead Plan: EVA 16 will be exploring Lith Canyon and the Dinosaur Quarry. EVA 17 will explore the area around Zubrin’s Head and Southwest. We will continue to work on learning ASL for 5 minutes each day as well as sharing stories about our lives so that the crew gets to know each other better.

Meanwhile, EVA-PM team took care of the GreenHab and wo/manned the fort. Upon her return, the Commander took Command of the kitchen and whipped up a delicious feast of pasta alfredo with chicken, spaghetti bolognaise and a hearty vegetable soup to whet her picky crew’s carnivorous, non-dairy and vegetarian predilections, respectively. In the late afternoon, EVA Team 2 took to the mean streets of Mars for a sojourn up North, certain that they would have turn back early due to mounting winds and increasing cloud cover. Alas, the winds of Mars made way for our fearless explorers, who had the time (and view) of their lives up by Copernicus way. In the midst of these EVAs, more scientific data was accrued and solar prominences observed by the science team and astronomer. The Sol will culminate with another hearty Martian spread come dinnertime, followed by some ‘Gold’-en opportunities for crew bonding, by way of ASL, cards and games.Look Ahead Plan:The week continues with more EVAs to the Moon by the EVA-AM team, and a PM trek over to Cactus Road with exploration of the near-by sights and sounds, with plans to forge on with the usual science, Hab operations and astronomy.Anomalies in work:1.

For lunch, we feasted on a delicious Martian lunch of Jamabalaya rice, broccoli and cheese soup, and fish. The afternoon was then spent on testing new radios and equipment, ongoing science experiments, finishing the MDRS sign, and usual Hab operations. Notably, our crew astronomer did a stellar job of picking up a solar flare, leading to the declaration of a state of emergency from the ensuing radiation storm, and reinforcing the good work we are doing scouting and mapping potential emergency shelters while on EVA. The remainder of the day was spend planning out our remaining week on Mars.Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow will be a mandatory rest day with no EVAs planned in anticipation of the 30C high. We will plan out the rest of our time here at MDRS, including a school visit on Sol 11, May the 4th on Sol 12, and end-of-rotation operations on Sol 13.Anomalies in work:1. Paintbrushes were not small enough for lettering on MDRS sign.2. Soldering iron is broken.Weather: Clear skies in AM, extremely hot by mid-day.Crew Physical Status: Affected crew member from EVA recovering nicely.EVA: The crew spent the morning going over principles of wilderness medical triage, evacuation and critical decision-making in case of accident while on EVA. We then moved these skills outside in our spacesuits, simulating various medical emergencies, including extraction from a rolled ATV while maintaining C-spine precautions (easier said than done in a spacesuit!).

EVA 6 was a successful failure in that valuable exploration of Lith Canyon was completed; however, the intended destination was the White Moon area! While EVA 6 was occurring, the plants were watered in the Green Hab and some vegetables were harvested. Our crew astronomer made a quick trip to the observatory and did some troubleshooting with the GPS units. Our crew engineer did work around the hab and communicated with mission control.The crew lunched together (thanks to our commander for cooking!) and then spent time on personal work and research projects before EVA 7. EVA seven was cut short at 1600 by the Health and Safety Officer over concerns of crew dehydration. Late afternoon was spent on reports. The plan for tonight is to watch a movie as a team, perhaps…. The Martian!!Look Ahead Plan: EVA 8 will attempt to complete the mission plan that was submitted for EVA 6 but not completed. EVA 9 will be exploring further into Candor Chasma as part of the GPS mapping study. We will continue to work on learning ASL for 5 minutes each day as well as sharing stories about our lives so that the crew gets to know each other better.Anomalies in work:1.

crew 192 - 17/04/2018," Nearing its end, aiming to fit in as much exploration as possible.Sol Activity Summary: The crew went on two great EVAs today, exploring parts of the Martian terrain that we haven’t yet seen. It’s fascinating to see just how many different kinds of soil, rock, and sediment you can find even in just one area, in varying colors, textures, shapes, and sizes. The winds were strong today (and last night) so extra caution was exercised during EVAs.Look Ahead Plan: Trying to fit in as many EVAs as possible (pending weather) since weekend weather may not be suitable and our mission ends on Saturday.Anomalies in Work: NoneWeather: Chilly, mix of clouds and sun, strong winds throughout the night and most of the day.Crew Physical Status: All crew are physically healthy and safe.EVA: See EVA Report.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary Report, EVA Report, EVA Request, Photo Report, Commander’s Report, GreenHab Report"
crew 192 - 16/04/2018,"Sol Activity Summary: Our day started with a visit from a tiny companion ? code name “Paul Watney” in honor of our missing crew member and “The Martian” ? who made his way into the upper deck of the hab. He accompanied us in the hab for the day but then decided to return to Mars. (see Photo Report)Our first EVA of the day was a long walking hike along the ridge. We climbed some of the dunes and hills and had to get creative along the way as there weren’t outlets or shallow spots where we thought they would be. One of the highlights of the hike was making our way up to the hab overview, which offered some amazing Martian views overlooking the hab.Our second EVA was shortened due to strong winds that increased as the day went one. It was turned into a short relocation EVA where we dropped off our tiny friend “Paul Watney” back onto the vast plains of Mars.The evening consisted of some more cooking for the crew, baking peanut butter cookies, and watching “Apollo 13.”Look Ahead Plan: Finish cleaning Water Tank and final skirt HAB clean up. Exploration continues to the south and spreading North.Anomalies in Work: NoneWeather: Chilly early on, warmer later in the day, mostly cloudy all day.Crew Physical Status: All crew are physically healthy and safe.EVA: See EVA Report.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary Report, EVA Report, EVA Request, Photo Report, Commander’s Report, GreenHab Report"
crew 192 - 15/04/2018," Today was a half-stand down day for the crew.Sol Activity Summary: One medical emergency simulation EVA in the afternoon, which taught the crew the basics of how to handle a medical emergency when out in the field on Mars. Crew doctor Ashok Narayanamoorthi shared the rules of what to do and what not to do, the most important being to remain calm.The afternoon consisted of a debrief, some knot-tying lessons with the Commander, a Martian Matinee (we watched ""Interstellar""), and some more fun cooking for dinner.Look Ahead Plan: We’re aiming for some solid EVAs this week, exploring the stretches of the Martian terrain.Anomalies in Work: NoneWeather: Warm, partly sunny early in the day, cloudy in the afternoon.Crew Physical Status: All crew are physically healthy and safe.EVA: See EVA Report.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary Report, EVA Report, EVA Request, Photo Report, Commander’s Report"
crew 192 - 14/04/2018," The crew is now halfway through their mission! We were very excited to get back to EVAs after the last 2-3 days of strong winds and cold temperatures.Sol Activity Summary: Today consisted of two really great EVAs for Crew 192. The weather started off cool and sunny and gradually became warmer, remaining clear and beautiful all day.At the end of the second EVA, we started work on a hab repair request to remove the skirting from all the way around the hab. Some of it has been removed and the rest will be worked on during our second week in sim.We ended up the day with an Italian meal of pasta and salad. Ciao bella!Look Ahead Plan: Some stargazing at night (we’ll be using some red astronomy lights for night vision), a half-day’s break tomorrow plus a medical simulation EVA, some more planning for hab repairs and EVAs for next week.Anomalies in Work: NoneWeather: Warm and sunny.Crew Physical Status: All crew are physically healthy and safe.EVA: See EVA Report.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary Report, GreenHab Report, EVA Report, EVA Request Journalist Report, Photo Report"
crew 192 - 13/04/2018," Our Mars mission has been slightly inhibited by approximately two and a half days of strong winds (paging Mark Watney), but like most scientists, the crew is keeping themselves busy and happy finding other things to do (repairs, cleaning, organization, cooking) until the weather calms down.Sol Activity Summary: With strong winds blowing again today, the crew attempted to gather a weather report before heading out on their first EVA of the day. Unfortunately, a sluggish connection prevented us from obtaining this prior to the EVA (Martian technology, right?). We left a little later than planned but were instructed to call off the outing, so we headed back inside to make a new plan for the morning and afternoon.The winds started to pick up again a bit, so the crew used the extra time inside to conduct a day of cleaning and organizing the hab. This turned out to be a worthwhile task as we removed layers of dust from many areas and long-unused objects and organized some of the boxes and bins in the lower deck. After this, the crew enjoyed a delicious brunch of nachos crafted by their own Richard Blakeman.We went ahead with our afternoon EVA as scheduled as the winds were slower than they were yesterday and our two crew members remained perfectly safe during their outing. Upon their return, we had a nice dinner, checked out the GreenHab together, looked through some of our many amazing mission photos so far, and planned for weekend EVAs and activities.Look Ahead Plan: The forecast says that the winds will die down tonight and the weather will be beautiful over the weekend. We’ll use that time to make up for the EVAs and other activities that were prohibited over the last couple of days due to the strong winds.Anomalies in Work: NoneWeather: Chilly and windy. Winds blowing at approximately 23 mph with gusts 30 mph.Crew Physical Status: All crew are physically healthy and safe.EVA: See EVA Report.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary Report, GreenHab Report, EVA Request, EVA Report Journalist Report, Photo Report"
crew 192 - 12/04/2018,"Sol Activity Summary: It was quite a busy day for Crew 192 as we spent almost all of our time literally “battening down the hatches” as severe winds caused the HAB some physical wear that needed repair and periodic observation.It began at ~0220 when the wind peeked. We had to tie down the center wooden cap for the structure because it kept slamming against the ceiling and being pulled up by the wind. It is now secure.We had an approved short morning scouting EVA …The commander recalled the team when the front airlock door vibrated and broke free from its hasp and the door swung open so hard that it broke the banister and damaged the habitat. The commander decided to have the team emergent repair the HAB by reattaching the hasp and screwing the banister back in place. The external repairs to the HAB must be made at a later date because they were not emergent and beyond the ability of the crew.We completed another engineering EVA (ALL HANDS EFFORT) to clean the trailer water tank in the RAM so that our next crew can maintain a large and safe supply of water. This involved stringing 550 cord to make a safety line which allowed all personnel to get to the HAB without issue in the mounting wind.Look Ahead Plan: The strong winds are forecast to continue into tomorrow and should slow down after that. Once it does, we will resume our exploration EVAs, continually exploring new sites and familiarizing ourselves further with ones we’ve already seen.Anomalies in Work: NoneWeather: Chilly and extremely windy. Winds blowing at approximately 30 mph with gusts 46 mph.Crew Physical Status: All crew are physically healthy and safe."
crew 192 - 11/04/2018," Today was the first really hot day of our mission, a surprise in between the last few days of cool weather and wind. We continued to explore further out into the Martian terrain, exercising extra caution this time to remain hydrated and not push ourselves past our limits in hazardous conditions. The search for our missing science experiments goes on and we simultaneously improvise new science experiments to execute in their place.Sol Activity Summary: Our day started early with our first EVA, where crew members Joe Dituri and Andreaa Radulescu went to explore another site to do a bit of hiking and geological investigation. When they returned we all had lunch together, which was followed by a brainstorming session for our next few EVAs.Then we relaxed and watched The Martian, which was surprisingly similar to our own mission (missing crew member, same number of remaining crew members, affinity for duck tape), especially since not long after, a crazy wind storm kicked up.Upon hearing a lot of commotion outside, we decided to have crew members Ashok Narayanamoorthi and Richard Blakeman head out on an engineering EVA prior to our scheduled evening EVA to check all around the hab. They found that a railing near the main door was broken because the front air lock door swung open and smashed railing. They made a couple of adjustments to secure the remaining piece as well as the hab door. Following that, the wind became so strong and started to present a safety hazard to the crew so the leader of the away team (Richard Blakeman) terminated the EVA.Look Ahead Plan: We will continue to extend our range of Martian exploration as far as we possibly can, but some forecast hazardous weather has prompted us to change up some of our EVA plans. With strong winds predicted for tomorrow and Friday, we may choose to instead remain closer to the hab and work on our water tank cleanup project in the RAM and resume exploration over the weekend. Safety ALWAYS comes first.Anomalies in Work: NoneWeather: Hot and windy. The temperature reached approximately 83 degrees today and the wind storm was severe.Crew Physical Status: All crew are physically healthy and safe.EVA: See EVA Report.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary Report, GreenHab Report, EVA Request, EVA Report Journalist Report, Commander’s Report, Photo Report, Science Report"
crew 192 - 10/04/2018," It was a beautiful day for EVAs over here for Crew 192 on Mars. We continue to clean and organize things around the hab and have started getting more comfortable with EVAs, which will allow us to continue the search for fascinating natural wonders as well as our missing science experiments and crew member. The mission is going well.Sol Activity Summary: The day started with a morning EVA, where three of our crew checked out the Marble Ritual site and surrounding area. They discovered some interesting geological structures and were particularly fascinated by a view of snow-capped mountains from a dusty, sandy red desert. After exploring, the crew returned to the hab, examined one of the hab’s water tanks for future cleaning, and headed inside for lunch.After a great afternoon session of debriefing, brainstorming, and improvising for additional science experiments, the remaining crew members headed out for another EVA, coming back with excited descriptions of their hike in Kissing Camels Ridge. They also had some insight into the length of time of EVAs, noting that the amount of hiking they did in their 2.5 hour EVA expended just enough of their energy without causing serious dehydration. They’ve advise the rest of us to limit high-impact EVAs to about two and a half hours for safety.We’re now resting and planning for tomorrow’s activities and may end the night with a space-based movie.Look Ahead Plan: The goal is continue stretching our EVAs a little further as we keep searching for our missing science experiments and crew member. Based on tonight’s hiking EVA, we also plan to pay special attention to crew health on EVAs, making sure everyone is healthy and comfortable and no one becomes dehydrated and ill. A little attention is also being put towards possible activities for our Yuri’s Night celebration.Anomalies in Work: NoneWeather: The weather was beautiful again today, the skies started out clear and the weather cool, which worked well for the first EVA. It became overcast from the afternoon on, which allowed our second EVA crew members to explore the sites with different skies overhead.Crew Physical Status: All crew are physically healthy and safe.EVA: See EVA Report.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary Report, GreenHab Report, EVA Request, Journalist Report, Commander’s Report, Photo Report"
crew 192 - 09/04/2018," Ground Control to Major Tom, PHEnOM Blue Crew 192 has landed at the Mars Desert Research Station. Unfortunately we’ve “lost” a crew-member during reentry to Mars. Our science adviser was accidentally jettisoned along with many of our scientific experiments. We have renamed our habitat the Bowie Base in honor of the inspiration from the “star Man” himself David Bowie. Our team’s mission is to overcome this adversity and persevere in the name of science. We have good intelligence that some of the projects may have survived reentry so we will be performing EVAs to scout possible locations where the science may have re-entered. We intend to perform pilot studies and other scientific information gathering techniques as well.Sol Activity Summary: We started our day by making sure we have an adequate water supply for our mission. Following that, we scouted the area around our habitat and took some photos for documentation. We also checked on our remaining science experiments like the locking mechanism of our observatory, which eventually opened after several unsuccessful attempts.Next, we tested our ATVs and rovers to make sure they’re working properly for our EVAs and scouting missions. It was interesting getting to use them on the dusty, sandy Martian landscape.After our test, we headed back inside the hab for our first crew dinner during our mission, and after that, two crew members conducted our first short-range EVA to test our spacesuits and communications devices. Upon their return, our GreenHab Officer went out to water the plants and our XO conducted a short engineering EVA around the hab for some repairs.Look Ahead Plan: As we continue to search for our lost science experiments, we’ll stretch our EVAs further and further out into the Martian landscape each day. We’re also experimenting with various types of dehydrated “space food” to see what brings us the best combination of nutrition, convenience, and satisfaction. Some of the dehydrated items have proven to be more difficult to cook with than expected.Anomalies in Work: NoneWeather: The weather was beautiful all day today, clear skies with very few clouds. We’re getting a good feel for the desert climate, it’s dryness, and its variation in temperature. It seems to be somewhat chilly in the morning, warmer by midday (even a bit hot), and cools down nicely at night, sometimes even becoming very cold during the night itself. The dry air is also a change for some of the crew.Crew Physical Status: All crew are physically healthy and safe.EVA: Today two crewmembers conducted one short-range EVA that lasted approximately one hour. See additional EVA report.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary Report, HSO Report, GreenHab Report, EVA Request, Journalist Report, Commander’s Report, Photo Report"
crew 192 - 08/04/2018," Crew 192’s mission is shaping up to be a great one. Today was largely spent preparing for our simulation, but the crew still managed to complete a handful of important tasks during their preparation and organization, such as some filling of the hab’s water tanks, a health/safety brief, and some pre-planning for their simulation.Sol Activity Summary: On our first full day at MDRS, we “flipped this hab!” We cleaned the hab top the bottom, including lots of mud that was tracked in after last night’s surprise rain. We also organized everything in hab, sorting all supplies in each area of the hab.Look Ahead Plan: The crew will finish up their pre-sim duties tomorrow morning and start their simulation tomorrow afternoon. The goal is complete a solid, uninterrupted sim, during which we will complete science experiments and explore personal and professionals goals.Anomalies in Work: There was a loose external part of the hab that became very loud in hitting an adjacent beam in the midst of strong winds. The crew patched up the part and the hab is running smoothly.Weather: It was sunny and warm most of the day, but some heavy winds picked up from around 1500 to approximately 1900.Crew Physical Status: All crew are physically healthy and safe.EVA: There were no EVAs done today as the crew is not yet in sim.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary Report, HSO Report, GreenHab Report, EVA Request"

crew 190 - 18/03/2018,"Today, it was planned to have a day off to relax, make the food inventory, clean up a bit the station and leave on EVA. After waking up, Michael and Sophie began a gym session while others were just relaxing up to midday. After that we had a Sunday lunch composed of mashed potatoes with chicken and compote. Our bellies being fully filled up, five crew members left for an EVA towards “yellow moon” to take soil samples, pictures and exploit the drone (see EVA report). Unfortunately, the weather was too windy and as a consequence it was impossible the fly with the drone. We came back to the Hab at 15h47 and we started to clean our living place. Shannon came to spoke with us about tracks found in the desert. This morning we have seen motorbikes and probably ATVs riding off road.Tonight we will have the dinner and a board game time to strengthen the team spirit.Concerning the food inventory, we will need some food supplies. It would be really appreciated if a space ship can bring us these food supplies.Regarding the station, a part from the MDRS aeration felt. During the EVA, we tried to dismantle the wheel of the broken rover. Unfortunately, the tools provided do not fit."

Tomorrow they will come to finish it. It looks amazing. Tomorrow we will be sending some pics! While the guys worked, we managed to turn on Shannon’s car, apparently, it will not need a new battery. However, we shouldn’t take your eyes off and go carefully in case this event repeats. We picked up a package that contains equipment to record some footage at MDRS and we filled the aquaponics with water to have it almost ready by the time the next crew arrives. By the way, the Green Hab plants are looking amazing.On our first day of adventure, we entered the Valley of the Stars in search of gypsum that may contain halophiles. Looking in any direction was simply spectacular. It is one of the most majestic places I’ve ever seen. We collected 5 different samples of vein, soil, and eruption. In a few days, we will be sending a Science Report with the findings of our first search.It has been a very hectic day. But I am happy with everything we have achieved today.

Never underestimate anything.Today I took Opportunity and Curiosity to consume their batteries to complete their charging cycles. Opportunity’s battery dropped 9 times faster than Curiosity’s, both have almost the same number of hours of use. We have theorized that the fact of having been constantly connected had a great influence. During Crew 188 rotation, Opportunity was disconnected most of the time. We will verify this theory during the following days. In any case, within this week it is planned to get all the extensions to plug every Rover.Today I had planned to send a GreenHab Report, but I’m just going to start working in the Green Hab, I plan to send it out tonight, but I do not think I can send it in time.

It was a lively chat about life on Mars as our crew ends our mission and their crew begins theirs. The conversation was recorded with several different cameras and a video will be spliced together with field footage.Soon after our final task, the crew ended our mission at 10:02 am local time bursting from the Hab front airlock with 5 cameras rolling. The blast of fresh air was refreshing but instantly followed by an intense day of cleaning the entire campus from top to bottom. We helped resupply some of the water tanks and removed garbage.The crew will enjoy relaxing on their last evening at MDRS. Thank you everyone for your support and for following our mission!

crew 188 - 09/02/2018,"As the Olympic flame is lit back on Earth, our physical challenges in the field come to a close. With two final EVAs, the crew is dusting off the suits and preparing them for the next crew who will start a week later. The morning EVA hiked up to the Hab Ridge for some final 360 filming, chlorophyll sampling and scenic views. The afternoon EVA had a few samples along the way to Toothy Ridge to the North. Final working photos were snapped with a few last planned for tomorrow during our campus cleanup.As with any online event on Earth, our Mars-2-Mars event will have a slight change of plans with the session being recorded on WebEx and shared immediately afterwards by the Austrian Space Forum (Österreichisches Weltraum Forum, OeWF). Q&A can be submitted to reddit and the crews will address them during the hangout or afterwards as an ongoing discussion.10Feb2018, 17:00 CET = 09:00 MDRS time (Sol 13) = 20:00 Oman time [16:00 GMT]reddit Q&A: https://www.reddit.com/r/Mars/comments/7s23yz/mdrs_crew_188_amaSpacesuit Up!Ryan L.

crew 188 - 07/02/2018,"Even with one EVA, the crew had a very busy and productive day. The EVA challenged the crew to a new slew of Martian Olympiad events counting down to the Winter Olympic Games back on Earth. An opening ceremony occurred and the crew hopes to share this artistic footage in high resolution 360 views. There are sure to be phots posted across social media, just look for #MDRS188. Meanwhile in the Hab, the NASA Glenn dust load experiment continued and air filtration dust samples were obtained from the EVA crew returning into the airlock. The afternoon was highlighted with staring at the Sun with a Hydrogen-alpha filter seeing sunspots, flares and even an airplane captured on camera passing in front of the Sun! The crew was busy digitally capturing video footage and audio for podcasts, school groups and for a mission documentary. After sunset the crew enjoyed watching the International Space Station pass-by briefly and an Iridium satellite. Who knows what space infrastructure Mars inhabitants will be able to watch from their homes, but they will need some form of planetary connectivity.Spacesuit Up!Ryan L. Kobrick, Ph.D.MDRS Crew 188 CommanderLook Ahead Plan:Two EVAs are panned that will fill most of the operational day.

crew 188 - 06/02/2018,"I think it goes without saying that our crew made many sacrifices to be a part of this two-week experience (finances, family, work, and much more). One that may not be obvious, and would have been impossible to time, was missing the Falcon Heavy historic launch. The unquestionable highlight for today was SpaceX’s success launch and landings, and what that may mean for future human spaceflight exploration. Today was packed with exploration. Two EVAs including a beautifully choreographed performance optimizing a 360 camera, and a driving excursion to uncharted territory. The crew was able to watch the launch and twin landings in a video later in the evening. Wow. Even watching the launch delayed had a similar impact to being there with family and friends in Florida. It was rocket-eye-candy-overload. Who knows when the next FH launch will be, or where any of us may be located, but we do know that these are the ingredients needed to make a mission to Mars feasible.Spacesuit Up!Ryan L. Kobrick, Ph.D.MDRS Crew 188 CommanderLook Ahead Plan:Tomorrow solar observations will continue in the morning hoping for calmer weather. An afternoon EVA will celebrate our international diversity and the upcoming Olympic Games with our own Martian Olympiad.Anomalies in work:None.Weather:The temperatures are cooling off and the winds remain high.Crew Physical Status:The crew has been burning on full throttle from 8am until 11pm and pushing hard to the finish line to be fully successful in their scientific and artistic investigations at MDRS.EVA:One is planned for tomorrow.Reports to file:1.

crew 188 - 05/02/2018,"This morning our team awoke to a beautifully and thoughtfully arranged breakfast table with a special greeting written by two crewmembers who wanted to help our team start week 2 of our mission on a high note. Each mission brings with it a unique set of challenges and rewards and I am humbled and proud to be part of such a courageous and strong team.Every morning at 08:30 we hold our Daily Planning Conference and one crewmember hosts a briefing of the upcoming EVA or team activity that will require the most coordination by all crew. We spent the mid-morning preparing for a 4-person EVA with the objective of scouting filming locations for a performing astronautics project by our Artist in Residence utilizing the Insta360 Pro camera. Two of our crew remained behind at the Hab to serve as HABCOM on the radio with the EVA team and keep up with science projects and tasks around the Hab.Following the EVA we shared lunch and set about working on our individual projects. We had a productive afternoon followed by a period of relaxation. Our crew is currently in good spirits and communication, stress management and team work is at an all-time high. In the evenings when our crew is not too exhausted, we have started hosting a lecture series here on Mars. After our comms window closes and our crew finishes dinner and dishes, the next scheduled crewmember to present will spend about 30-45 minutes sharing a topic that they are either passionate about or teaching a useful skill. Our crew is comprised of six individuals with strong personal and professional backgrounds that make for informative evening sessions that bond and inspire us.Ad Astra!Renee GarifiMDRS Crew 188 Executive OfficerLook Ahead Plan:We will perform EVA #10 in the morning tomorrow and EVA #11 in the afternoon.Anomalies in work:None.Weather:Windy, but not like the high winds of yesterday.

crew 188 - 04/02/2018,"Today’s highlights included a pedestrian EVA back to Hab Ridge for micrometeorite and chlorophyll sample collection and scenic views with Tat, Julia, and Renee. The crew enjoyed performing the bubbles experiment a few times including by the science dome for a short video recording. During the morning, Sarah Jane and Zac helped with the spacesuit mobility study that I am conducting with my ERAU S.U.I.T. Lab (see @SpacesuitUp) at several analogue station locations around the world. SJ worked as the technician and Zac the suited/unsuited test subject.Afterwards the crew had a big lunch followed by round 2 of Tat’s human factors study. It was a very enlightening conversation that identified how we could all help each other with our scientific goals during the mission. There are a lot of projects underway being managed in a delicate balance and a short time budget. Many of the projects already have publication plans lined up at peer reviewed conferences or with partnerships at universities and museums for exhibits. We owe it to our partner PIs around the world to extract the best possible data possible while roaming the red desert.In the early evening, our #SuperScienceSunday blitz did not go as planned to help reach the public with our messages about exploration and education. Not all plans happen as intended, but flexibility and perseverance will keep our team bonded to face challenges to share something bigger, something that cannot be explained in abundant daily reports and occasional snaps on social media. Our crew wound down with a group meditation session in the science dome, followed by open and very personal discussion, and was crowned with a yoga session to stretch our legs for the next EVA and the next challenge.Spacesuit Up!Ryan L. Kobrick, Ph.D.MDRS Crew 188 CommanderLook Ahead Plan:Tomorrow EVA 9 will take the crew to a site first explored by Crew 187 in the south regions of our exploration zone. Crew members will work on various projects at the Hab. The following day is likely to be followed by two EVAs so that we can meet our exploration and scientific objectives.

crew 188 - 03/02/2018,"A two-EVA day today kept the crew busy all day. The morning EVA (Renee, Julia, and I) went North to discover the ""Goblins"" in Lith Canyon. The crew followed an ancient stream bed into the canyon, a familiar site for myself once we reached a few of the more memorable dips, with a grand opening from rolling red cliffs to an open field followed by a deep canyon drop area near what we hope to confirm was the correct location.The afternoon EVA (Zac, Tat, and SJ) can be summarized by two words, windy bubbles. EVA double-oh-seven ventured by foot North and scrambled up the red cliffs near Sagan Road to reach the Hab Ridge Road. Performing a variety of bubbles experiments, the crew experience upper wind limits for their expedition. They walked south towards the Hab for a scenic view of our campus from above.Meanwhile back in the Hab, I was in full science mode taking dust measurements in the airlock and uploading biometric data to Earth. The winds are expected to keep the Hab cool overnight leading into Super Science Sunday… I mean Super Bowl Sunday. The crew is planning to coordinate outreach activities to see if we can help raise awareness for human spaceflight and Mars-forward research.Spacesuit Up!Ryan L. Kobrick, Ph.D.MDRS Crew 188 CommanderLook Ahead Plan:EVA 8 is being planned to take the crew back up on the Hab Ridge for sample collection and scenic views. The ERAU spacesuit mobility study is being planned for video capture in the science dome. IN the afternoon we will have our next installment of the human factors study.

crew 188 - 02/02/2018,"Today the crew completed EVA #5 and had a successful afternoon of setting up scientific research hardware, working on personal outreach projects and getting to the overdue tasks that have been previously placed on hold in order to keep pace with the busy mission. We will soon wrap up week number 1 in our home sweet Hab here at MDRS.The EVA team was excited to share their geological samples collected in the field with the HAB team as soon as they arrived back through the airlock. Julia’s favorite rock found today was a vibrant eye-catching red color that seemed otherworldly and intriguing. They explored a canyon route along Cactus Road and took breathtaking photos and videos of their trek while scouting sights for future science sample collections. Tomorrow, we will be conducting two EVAs with the first scouting for potential micrometeorite deposit sights and collect top soil samples from hill tops to be analyzed for very small micrometeorite rocks. The second will have the crew exploring Hab Ridge by foot to continue to explore our surroundings.The crew took some well-deserved personal time this afternoon to refresh and gear up for closing out week 1 of our mission. We are looking forward to watching Groundhog Day for the humor and irony (today is Groundhog Day in the USA).Ad Astra!Renee GarifiMDRS Crew 188 Executive OfficerLook Ahead Plan:EVA 6 is planned for tomorrow to revisit a site from EVA 2 and to further add navigation and waypoint data for the crew to use on all EVAs.

crew 188 - 01/02/2018,"Let’s jump to the bottom line. My hiking boots were completely destroyed on our hike to Phobos Peak with the soles peeling off the bottom. An EVA with modest to difficult objectives was challenged with equipment failures and ingenuity to solve problems as they occurred. This is the type of exploration we need for a Mars mission. Calculating risks, making decisions, and with collective exploration experience solving problems. There’s going to be a lot of problems. The EVA Macgyver of the day was Sarah Jane, fixing one boot with a safety whistle, and the other with my laces and some zip ties I was using. Between Julia, SJ and I we were challenged physically and mentally. I had suggested Phobos Peak for the EVA, and I was clearly willing to lose my boots over it. Luckily my hiking shoes are rugged and ready to step up to the next EVA challenge.The crew enjoyed the scenic views from the science dome during a session of Kung Fu Thai Chi in the morning. Every morning needs to start off on the right foot… even if part of your foot falls off later. The crew also cracked into Cottage Cheese with Blackcurrant Puree space desert from the Russian Space Food Laboratory. It’s apparently “approved by space”. Further work continued on the NASA VEGGIE OASYS project in the Green Hab. We also finally opened the dust load experiment that I am running from NASA Glenn Research Center. I’m excited to set up the hardware and see how much dust we are tracking into the hab. It’s a dusty environment, and knowing how dirty it gets during key activities (EVA airlock, post EVA clean up, and more) we can help prepare future life support systems with the correct type of filters.Spacesuit Up!Ryan L.

crew 188 - 31/01/2018,"Sol 2 merged into Sol 3 with the astronomical Super Blue Blood Moon event! The crew had varying levels of sleep hours leading into the early morning event. As you may have seen from earlier reports this was a very rare event, and the show met all expectations. All crew members were able to watch the Moon slowly disappear behind Earth’s shadow leaving a red glowing Moon. Looking at the red Moon created nice mental links to our Martian experience and submersion and let us ponder what it would be like to watch a dual-lunar event on Mars. Because of the rare event, today was dedicated to ramping up our science projects and resting for future EVAs. Personally I worked on my EVA metric study with the help of Tat to edit and name waypoints and record key data into a master spreadsheet. I also recorded a video podcast to post publicly (hopefully soon) interviewing Dr. Sarah Jane Pell. I am sure my students will find it very interesting and I’m expecting their follow up questions will be great! Renee and Zac started working on setting up the prototype of NASA Kennedy Space Center’s VEGGIE OASYS experiment in the Green Hab. It is great that the crew gets to work on an experiment that may one day be used on Mars, and super cool that it is already on the International Space Station. Thank you Dr. Luke Roberson for being the quarterback of this project at NASA KSC! Julia and Zac were also working in the Green Hab today, optimizing the layout and tending to the plants. Tat started a human factors analysis for the MDRS operational structure. This study could lead to consolidated task management and more efficient processes. The lighter day allowed the crew to sync files and prepare to share their experience. Several crewmembers sewed their mission patches onto their flight suits today, preparing to explore in style.Spacesuit Up!Ryan L. Kobrick, Ph.D.MDRS Crew 188 CommanderLook Ahead Plan:In the morning three crew members will head East to Phobos peak to examine human performance and capture 360 footage in 8k. The afternoon EVA will scout more roads and re-visit a previous site.

crew 188 - 30/01/2018,"We awoke this morning to a beautiful Martian sunrise and amazing view of the alien landscape out the port hole windows on the second floor of the hab. We held our daily planning conference over breakfast where we mapped out our plan for the day including EVA prep, research hardware set up and how best to accomplish our daily tasks. We also spent some time checking in with each crewmember to discuss factors affecting our health, stress and personal mission goals. We had a positive discussion and everyone felt heard, which is important to the leadership of this team.We began EVA prep at 09:30 and sent 3 members of our team through the airlock to explore the Martian terrain while the 3 remaining crew set to work setting up research hardware in the greenhouse and science lab. The Artist in Residence and Crew Astronomer have been working all day to prepare a special 360 degree video of the Super Blue Blood Moon Eclipse which begins tonight. Our best viewing opportunity will begin at 04:44 am.One very exciting event occurred after our EVA crew returned. We received a cargo shipment of our embroidered mission patches! This provided our crew with an unexpected morale boost and helped us feel that much more excited about carrying out a high fidelity analog mission worthy of an official crew mission patch.Ad astra!Renee GarifiMDRS Crew 188 Executive OfficerLook Ahead Plan:In the late evening/early morning tomorrow, all crewmembers will rise at 04:00 am to view the special astronomical mega event of the lunar eclipse of the January Blue Moon.Anomalies in work:MDRS Director is coordinating power system updates with contractors.

crew 188 - 29/01/2018,"The mission kicked off 1:01:01 local time after a morning of spacesuit training and navigational discussions of the exploration zone. As the terrain changes, each subsequent crew on the ""red planet"" adjusts to imposed closures of some roads, while other pathways open for exploration. The crew snapped team photos with four nations and four flags, (Canada, USA, Australia, and Japan), and with the one uniting Mars Red-Green-Blue flag.The crew planned and executed two EVAs geared towards a technical shakedown of equipment and MDRS traditions located at ""Marble Ritual"". Three crewmembers on each EVA drove surface vehicles to a predetermined destination to make sure the surface suits were adjusted, vehicles driven suited (the ATVs and Rovers), and then on-foot exploration. Additionally, cameras, GPS units, biomedical devices, tablets, and specialized gloves were all tested in Martian analog conditions.The relived to be underway the crew also realizes that the clock is ticking on their mission and there is a lot of data to collect and share.

crew 187 - 27/01/2018,"Hello Earth,How much has the Earth changed since the Sol 1?It’s hard to explain in words all the feelings. Sadness and happiness at the same time. Let’s explain to you what we did during our last day, then there will be time for farewells. Today we woke up at 07:30, we ate our last breakfast here on Mars, and started to clean all the Hab, the lower and the upper deck, the GreenHab, the science dome and the observatory. Every Martian was running around cleaning everything, keeping their things, cooking and so on. Then Dr. Ruppert came back to check everything. At 15:00, Atila, Danton and I went to welcome the Crew 188 from ISU… Welcome guys to Mars! We hope you really enjoy living here as much we did! When every Martian arrives at the Hab we did a tour for Crew 188 showing them the GreenHab, the science dome, the Musk observatory and everything here, our home. Later, Shannon visited us to explain to crew 188 how is living on Mars. Meanwhile, Danton flew his drone around the Hab to do the aerial 3D mapping. And, at 17:00, we teleport to Earth for eating hamburgers and chicken… Yummy! A long time ago that we didn’t eat terrestrial food. When we came back to Hab, we started to write the reports for capCom and we answered doubts that could have the crew 188. By the end of the night, crew 187 are together talking about our projects, our lives, and so on … as a Martian Family!It’s time to say goodbye! This place was our home, our sweet home. We have a lot of good memories here on Mars. I was lucky to have as my crew, the best Martians in the Universe. It was an honor to be the commander of the crew 187. Every Martian was a key to survive to this great adventure that is to live on Mars.

Today we woke up in different hours. By 09:30, every Martian was awake. We ate breakfast; then, Oscar, Danton, Tania and I were getting ready for the last adventure as Martians. At 10:35, we started our last exploration; this time we found the right way at once, we arrived at the unknown canyon at 11:45. Again… we are the first crew in there… That feeling is awesome!!! You can’t imagine that kind of sensation. We would like to give it a name. Despacito road and Porg canyon, because, we consider that the road is dangerous so you have to drive slowly (slowly in Spanish is Despacito). In addition, It’s important to mention that Porg is the official pet of the crew 187, he always stays with us in all the adventures; therefore, we would like to leave a mark of our official pet.We strongly recommend you to go to Porg Canyon! And drive very slowly in Despacito road, it’s for your security! The view in Porg canyon is beautiful, it’s a geological rich area. Thanks Shannon for recommending us this place!At 14:45, we were inside the Hab. One hour and a half later, well, exactly talking, at 16:10, the extraordinary EVA began, at 17:10, they came back to home.Later, Danton fly the drone around the Hab to do the aerial 3D mapping. At 18:20, wow, the moment that none Martian wants to arrive, arrived!… From that time, we were out of sim! But we feel like we are still Martians, at least, we are going to feel it until we left the MDRS and come back to Earth.Currently, every Martian is running doing reports and the Mission Summary.

crew 187 - 25/01/2018,"Hi Earth,How is everything going on there?Last night we went to see the starry sky of Mars; however, the cloudy sky did not allow us to observe the beautiful Martian sky. There are only a few days left on Mars, if it depends on us, we would stay on Mars for much longer. The fatigue is felt in the Martians; on Mars, the hours pass faster than Earth. We slept late talking, coordinating things, moving forward in our projects and so on. Today we woke up at different times, but at 9:30 we were all ready to take breakfasts. One hour later, the Martian explorers, Atila, Luis, Tania and David started their adventure. Our explorers arrived at Mountain Goat Trail when they realized that they were in the wrong way to Candor Chasma. Then, they came back almost to Galileo Road 104… OMG!… again! The Martian explorers, couldn’t find the right way, as yesterday, the third one is the defeated. Therefore, at 12:03, they arrived at the right point and walked for 100 minutes until they came back to the rovers.Meanwhile, in the Hab, Danton, Oscar and I got ready for the gala dinner. Of course, the chef in charge of the kitchen was our Martian chef Oscar. Danton and I were in charge of the cleaning. When the Martian explorers arrived at the Hab, we ate lunch together. Later, David helped me taking pictures for my project.

We ate breakfast together while we speaking about the life and a lot of things. Later, we did the psychological tests of Danton’s project. Just before noon, our Martian explorers were ready to start their adventure. At 11:45, Atila, Oscar, David and Danton started their depressurization. Nine minutes later, they left the habitat and disappear in the horizon. At 12:30, the Martian explorers arrived at Quary Rd. Oscar’s rover was tested and Danton’s drone flew to make a 3D mapping of the area. Five minutes before 14 hrs, the Hab received the explorers and we ate a vegetarian lunch together, cooked by the Martian Chef, Oscar. At least for one day, we knew the feeling of eating as our favorite as our favorite Martian vegetarian, David.In the afternoon, The Martians took a nap while Oscar was reading Artemis from Andy Weir and I was working on my project (programming and recognizing objects).Before CapCom, the crew went to the observatory and use the Celestron telescope. The view of the moon and the Orion Nebula from Mars is wonderful. Currently, everybody is doing a report for CapCom, After the sign-off, we are going to come back to the Observatory to continue watching the starts from Mars, therefore, tomorrow wait for an Astronomy Report!Ad Astra,Cynthia Fuertes PanizoCommander Crew 187 – MDRSLook Ahead Plan:Tomorrow, The Martian explorers are going to Candor Chasma Canyon.

Enough for the rest of our stay on Mars … Thanks Earth! At 10:00, Tania, Danton, Oscar and I started getting ready for today’s excursion. The adventure started at 10:35, we went driving in the main road until Special Region, where we realized that we were not in the place that we were supposed to be. Therefore, we came back… OMG! The entrance to Lith canyon is not very clear, so we were driving until the White Moon when we realized that we realized that we were not in the place that we were supposed to be… again! As it’s said in our homes in Earth, the third is the defeated one. So, this time we could find the right way to Lith Canyon, a way in the middle of desert. We were driving around 20 minutes after left the main road. When finally, around 12:15 we arrived to the final destiny the Commander, The HSO, EVA Officer and the journalist started the expedition to immerse inside Lith Canyon. At 14:45 finished the expedition and after that, at 15:05 the we stopped to take some data and recollect specimen of salt in the middle of way. At 15:25, we finally arrived at the hab without problems however with a delay of 30 minutes. When the first expedition arrived the second expedition with the Greenhab, XO and the Crew Engineer left the hab at 12:40 with the objective to test the curiosity, opportunity and Spirit rovers. The second crew arrived 16:50 to the hab without problems.Moreover, it’s important to mention that David and Luis built and installed an alarm to prevent that the water tank exceeds its level. They used an ultrasound sensor, a nano arduino, a transistor and an horn of a damaged radio.Finally, the crew decided to relax at the night to be ready for the next adventure.Ad Astra,Cynthia Fuertes PanizoCommander Crew 187 – MDRSLook Ahead Plan:Tomorrow there will be a short excursion.

crew 187 - 22/01/2018,"Houston… we have a problem!Today we decided to wake up in order to rest for the EVA of today. Every Martian woke up in different hours. The majority of them were taking a breakfast at 08:15, but there is always someone who falls asleep and gets up late, at 9:30, and woke up only by the noise that made two earthlings who visited our home on Mars to fix the water heater and water filter. Due to this, 130 gallons of water were used today… Earth, we need more water to survive on Mars!In the morning, Oscar was working in the programing phase of his project, and in the afternoon his rover was tested inside the tunnels. It’s magic how the rover can move through rocks, sands and can climb the tunnel’s walls. David and I were working in our projects in the Greenhab. Moreover, Atila is trying to fix the Science Dom’s door. At 10:35, every Martian were in the upper deck to help each other to prepare for the EVA of today. At 12:00, David, Atila, Luis and Danton were in the airlock ready for their adventure. However, at 12:47 Hab copied a radio signal from the Martian explorers. Due to the fact that Opportunity charger was getting down fast; in 18 minutes the battery got down more than 10% arriving until 64%. And prioritizing the safety of the crew’s members, it was decided to come back to the Hab. The decision taking was that the explorers got inside the Hab, ate a lunch, warmed up, and started again the EVA. Oscar cooked very quickly eggs with cheese for the Martian explorers of the day. For the second excursion, Deimos and two 350 ATV were being used. In the afternoon, Tania, Oscar and I cleaned the Kitchen and did a food inventory. We found some interesting food that we can eat in the following days. At 16:45 Hab didn’t know anything about the Martian explorers and we started to worry about it. At 16:56, Hab copied the first radio signal and we realized that every Martian was ok but something happened. At 14:50, the Martian explorers arrived to Copernicus Hwy. The Martians described the view as the best landscape that they have ever seen in their lives. At 13:50, the Martian explorers were ready to come back to home. At 16:45 Deimos stoped and the Martian worked together using jumping cables to tow Deimos, that’s why they arrived to Hab at 18:20. At 17:45, Shannon found the Martian explorers and helped them to solve the problem.The day was a really crazy day… but come on! We are on Mars! We are Martians! And the important thing is that we knew how to solve it!Ad Astra,Cynthia Fuertes PanizoCommander Crew 187 – MDRSLook Ahead Plan:We hope to have another adventure for tomorrow… We are going to Lith Canyon!

The tiredness begins to be noticed because the naps are more common between meals. At 11:00 our Martian chef, Danton, started to cooked a delicious food: Chicken with cheese, pasta and vegetables. We ate together before the expedition began. At 11:30, Tania, David, Luis and Oscar started the donning time. They took Opportunity and Spirit for this adventure… It’s supposed that they were going to work in El Dorado Canyon, but it was a confusion with the location so they visited a near canyon. However, they took some samples of the halophiles needed. The path that they follow was bent. The canyon that the Martians explorers visited combines a wide variety of landscapes, from rocks up to 5 meters high, which route land for an approximate of 500 meters between ascents and descents and with different types of soil and frozen water remains.By 15:00, our chef Danton started to cooked a second lunch for our Martian explorers, a delicious soup and scrambled eggs with chili. They arrived at 15:20 to our home. And 25 minutes later we started to eat together… again!In the afternoon, we got a refill of 125 gallons from the water (trailer). Now we have water for the rest of our lives in Mars, or at least, we hope so.David is replanting 12 quinua’s plants on the lysimeter for his project.

Pay attention to the word “Intention”, every Martian slept on the sofas before the movie was over. So today we woke up a little late, and started our daily exercises at 8:15 led by me, and because the days are not perfect, in the middle of the exercise routine a crew member suddenly fell to the floor. For 10 seconds we did not know if her tears were nerves, pain or just laughter. Everything is fine! Then we ate breakfast and every Martian started to work in their projects. Besides, Luis and I checked the status of the Astronomy laptop. At 9:10 a resupply food arrived from Earth… Thanks for it!!! We celebrated it with a delicious lunch cooked by Danton, a traditional Mexican fried beans with scrambled eggs with chili was the magic lunch of this Martian day!

Then we ate cereals for breakfast.During the day, I met every Martian in order to know how their projects going on. Their projects have different kinds of topics like augmented reality applications, space suit simulators, communication, psychology tests, agriculture, astronomic pictures, and so on.Today, Danton and I had our EVA to create a 3D Map of the MDRS. It’s splendid the pictures and videos that you can get using a drone.Until now, this day was the most terrestrial day that we ever have since we arrived at Mars, when we realized that we were almost out of diesel, we activated our protocols of emergence turning off everything that is possible to turn it off (the power of the Greenhab of course not!); allowing to charge the batteries using the solar panel as soon as possible. We were planning to use the energy that we got at night, moreover, we were willing to sleep in the Greenhab because is warm and we wanted to transmit our heat to the plants. We are on Mars; we have to take care of every plant that we have. Fortunately, Shannon arrived at 15:20 and saved our Martian lives with 15 gals of diesel. Every Martian worked together to accomplish the vital activity to refill the tank with diesel and we got it! There are a lot of probabilities to have a stormy day tomorrow and now we are ready for it!Days before the crew listened a woman yelling, today talking with Shannon about it and the mountain lion’s footprints that we saw in El Dorado Canyon; we can say that we are not alone in the MDRS, around us there are cougars (they yell like a woman).What a crazy day! … Now every Martian is writing their reports for Capcom, then we are going to eat a dinner together and start to plan our next EVA for Sunday because, for the weather, tomorrow will be inside the Hab.We want to visit El Dorado canyon again!Ad Astra,Cynthia F.

Then, one by one took the psychological test for Danton’s project while Danton was the Martian chef of the day! he cooked us a delicious combination of Salmon with a salad made of potatoes, cheese and Broccoli. We ate together before our first long EVA take place. The donning’s time started at 13:16, and after 5 minutes of depressurization, the real adventure began! The group already knew each other, it was their second EVA together, this astounding group were formed by Oscar, Danton, Atila and I. We went to unnamed canyon using two rovers (Curiosity and Deimos). A lot of Martian and Terrestrial things happened. Since the moment we arrived, we could feel the magic of the place. We were walking finding deer’s footprints, after 20 minutes we couldn’t believe what we see, we found fresh mountain lion’s footprints, something that reminded us that we are terrestrial. Everyone’s safety is the number one priority, that’s why we stood up in that moment and decided to fly the drone to see if there will be any chance of danger. Fortunately, the drone doesn’t get anything that goes against our safety. In the way back to the rovers, we couldn’t stop to appreciate the saline deposits. As a crew 187, we named this wonderful place as El Dorado Canyon, because El Dorado was an ancient legend about a city full of gold that challenged every explorer who dared to look for it. For us to call it that reflects the curiosity that awoke in us as new explorers of Mars and the desire to leave in there a Latin American mark.In the moment we arrive to the Hab, Oscar had to get into the airlock because the battery of his space suit was drained and it can represent a potential problem. Danton, Atila and I kept working outside, for 15 minutes more, in the RAM and taking some pictures and videos using a drone.After this amazing experience, we were so happy to see that the rest of the crew cooked for us, we ate a second lunch together and then everybody started to work in their reports and projects.This day was a long productive day…Mars, here we are!Look Ahead Plan:Danton and I will do a short EVA to make a map of the MDRS.Anomalies in work:None.Weather: Temperature: 3°C, Fair weather, Winds speed: calm, Humidity 38%, Barometer 30.20 inCrew Physical Status: HealthyReports to be filed: Sol Summary, GeenHab Report, Operations Report, EVA Request, EVA Report, and Journalist Report."

At 08:00, we ate breakfast together while we did the briefing.The day looked promising because today we will be our first EVAs. We wanted to assets the performance of the crew with the suitsoperations, so the routine of each EVA was to walk over even terrain, then drive using ATVs and Curiosity; and finally we made summit in Overlook Reach. The first group of the EVA was conformed by Atila, Oscar Danton and I; their time of donning started at 11:00 until 11:30, in that moment the real adventure began and lasted until 13:00. Later, in the habitat they gave advices to the following group of EVA. The second group was conformed by Atila, Tania, Luis and David. Their expedition lasted until 15:30. Both EVA was led by Atila.

Once the EVA team had departed, Mark and Max began to harvest the microgreens from GreenHab. The EVA team returned with spectra and samples of the shales found in the region, along with a handful of shell fossils they had picked up on the way back through the Moons region. On Mars, such a discovery would be the scientific finding of the century. But here in the Moons region, they are so common as for it to be almost impossible to avoid stepping on them.Once the sun had set, the team rotated through GreenHab and the Science dome collecting, weighing and cataloging our bountiful harvest of radish microgreens, green beans, cilantro, dill and lettuce. Finally, for our last meal in sim before our return to Earth, we subjected the food to its most critical experiment of all: Ingestion.Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow is handoff day.

crew 186 - 11/01/2018," Preparing for a grand finale EVA to a geology site we have saved especially for our last EVA.Sol Activity Summary: The sun came back out today, much to our appreciation (and the appreciation of our solar panels). Any problem can be fixed in a spacecraft as long as you still have power and comms, and it has been a great weight off our shoulders to only view cloudy days as a mild annoyance, rather than a critical power threat as they might be on a pure solar mission.The clear weather allowed for our last navigation EVA to take place as scheduled. We now have four complete demonstrations of an astronaut using nothing but the radio beacon to safely return to the hab, two where the astronaut had no experience with the system, and an impaired range of vision. I’m very pleased with Justin for producing such a practical aid to navigation in places where no gps is available (such as Mars … for now at least). It’s an early back to school for some of us, as Melanie has begun taking us on short engineering EVAs to test the efficacy of the VR training module she has developed for teaching EVA tasks. Around the hab, we continue to check off the last remaining items on our individual projects so we can face handoff with a clear schedule.On a personal note, today was the first day I really saw GreenHab as more than just a greenhouse. I remember contributing to the Kickstarter campaign to rebuild Greenhab after the fire, and it has made me immeasurably proud to see it continue to thrive and grow under Mark’s skillful control while we are here. Stepping into the tropical heat and humidity of GreenHab today after a cold and dry EVA felt as relaxing as stepping into a hot tub. I sat down amidst the plants to appreciate the magnificent oasis thriving in this red/brown landscape, and the environment was so placid that I was not at all surprised when I woke up 15 minutes later to find I had drifted to sleep in my chair. Greenhouse, oasis, zen garden, GreenHab is much more now than just a place where plants grow.Look Ahead Plan: Our last EVA will take place tomorrow, with one final geological survey to the highest elevation site on our list at the base of Skyline Ridge. Harvesting of our carefully grown GreenHab bounty will also take place tomorrow, we are planning to exit sim at noon on Saturday 01/13.Anomalies in work: NoneWeather: 6C, Wind SSE 8km/h, Fair, Humidity 52%Crew Physical Status: HealthyEVA: Preliminary photography of the Plane of Dirt / Skyline Ridge region for the last geology EVA, then walk back to the hab to test the radio navigation system.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, GreenHab Report, Journalist Report, EVA Report, EVA Request"
crew 186 - 09/01/2018," Spending the day in hab due to a light snowSol Activity Summary: We awoke to cloudy skies and a light snow dusting all around the habitat. The snow was still falling by the time we had finished morning yoga and breakfast, so we decided to postpone today’s EVA. The snow let up by the late morning, but by that point, too much time had passed to complete the EVA before our scheduled return time. This will happen on Mars, there is no more a guarantee of cooperative weather there than there is on Earth, and it’s something future crews will have to learn to work around. Instead we broke out our blankets, sleeping bags, and laptops, and spent the rest of the day working on our own projects. We shared an all crew lunch of mac-n-cheese prepared by Melanie (which was a nice departure from routine, as we are usually on our own for lunch due to EVA scheduling). GreenHab is nearing harvest time, and two dinners from now we are planning a green feast of its bounty of microgreen, lettuce, beans and herbs. And we were even happier to receive a radio call in the afternoon indicating a supply ship had delivered us a new bread maker! We have set it up in our kitchen, and are planning to break it in (de-flour it?) at dinner tonight.Look Ahead Plan: The uncompleted EVA 8, scheduled for today from 1030-0130, will be rescheduled to tomorrow from 1230-0330, which is after the rain/snow is forecasted to have stopped and the temperatures will have risen above freezing.

We are also making sure our individual projects will be finished by the end of the mission (just 5 sols from now!).Sol Activity Summary: Our last EVA to the Moons region was cut short, so we revisited each of the Moons regions and collected a sample of the clay and salt at each site that we had not been able to get the first time. The color contrast from region to region was remarkable to behold; blues, reds, yellows, greys, all due to just small changes in soil chemistry. After we got within 2km of the hab on the way back, we dismounted and tested the radio beacon system to navigate the rest of the way home. Justin and Kshitij then ran a quick three sorties back on the rover to recover the ATVs. Once we were all back at the hab and warmed up, we did some planning for a media event the entire crew will be participating in 2 days from now for students and faculty back at Purdue. Mark spent the day in GreenHab composing some documents to aid future GreenHab officers, Melanie continued the programming of her VR training module, while Sam and Cesare caught up on their own experiments in the science dome.When we all were back at the hab, Sam filmed a tour of the entire MDRS facility with each of us explaining our roles as part of the crew, then we settled in for an evening episode of ‘Black Mirror’, which has become our crew’s go-to mode for relaxation (And if you’ve ever seen ‘Black Mirror’ you’ll understand why its success at relaxing us is… mixed.)Look Ahead Plan: Today was the first completely successful test of the navigation system on EVA, we will attempt to replicate the results tomorrow under more challenging conditions on a shorter EVA. The weather forecast is looking less favorable for the next 48 hours, so all EVA plans will be weather contingent.Anomalies in work: None.Weather: 1C, winds calm, humidity 80%, Pressure 30.20 inHgCrew Physical Status: HealthyEVA: Yellow moon, white moon, beige moon, walk backReports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Journalist Report, Science Report, Greenhab Report, EVA Report, EVA Request"
crew 186 - 07/01/2018," Back into our regular routine after our relaxing day offSol Activity Summary: Today was a follow-up EVA east of the Maxwell Montes area to try and get up close to the stratified cuts in the canyon wall that we found on EVA 3. The USGS topo maps that we had downloaded before our mission made navigation through the canyon possible, but still error-prone. We were not able to reach the stratified layer feature we had previously located, but we did locate another wall along the way in a side canyon with an equally good stratified structure and elected to conduct our sampling there instead of continuing on to the target site (which was still 0.5 miles away). As this canyon is just off the edge of the MDRS map and has no feature name, we have elected to informally name it after our college mascot, Boilermaker Canyon. See the EVA report for more details on navigation. Tonight we plan to make time for some astronomy and an early bedtime.Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow’s EVA will revisit the Moons region to target the sites we missed on the first visit to the region, then conduct a walk back experiment with the navigation equipment.Anomalies in work: The commander experienced communication troubles on this EVA when a radio battery started giving a low voltage warning while en route to the site. By turning the radio off and only turning it on when communications were required, we were able to extend its life until we reached the EVA site. But it meant that the commander was required to always remain within easy reach of another crew member so instructions could be relayed to turn on their radio via hand gestures or simulated helmet contact. As the commander was responsible for navigation, the commander and engineer swapped radios on the way back and walked single file with the incommunicado radio in the 2nd position in line, ensuring the commander had good comm and could direct the navigation out of the canyon. HSO also experienced a loss of radio comms while walking back to the rovers, but this was traced back to the radio inadvertently being placed in scan mode. Communications were restored once this way corrected.As this is now the second time an apparently fully charged radio has failed to hold charge on EVA, we are implementing a new policy on all our future EVAs that 2 fully charged spare radios will be put in the EVA box, and carried with the EVA team at all times, to be swapped in the event of a low radio battery. This was the most physically intensive EVA we had conducted so far, and we made use of the reserve water supply once we returned to the rovers, drinking it through a camelback to avoid breaking sim.

crew 186 - 06/01/2018," Enjoying our first day of light duty and the chance to catch up on our individual work.Sol Activity Summary: As grad students, soon to be grad students or recently escaped grad students, one of our greatest pleasures is to sleep in. And today we did just that, in celebration of reaching the midpoint of our 13 sol mission. We woke on our own schedule, and enjoyed a brunch of scrambled eggs and french toast. We recommend a new standing policy be implemented on Mars missions: AHTBMR, aka, “Always Have The Bread Maker Running”.A passing comment about Game of Thrones (which GreenHab officer Mark Gee had finished reading that morning) became an engaging discussion about authorial intent and the discernment of canon in fictional universes, over the course of 2 hours spanned such topics as the Star Wars Holiday Special, Ender’s Game, the Bible, and literary theorist Roland Barthes’ essay “Death of the Author”. In the course of the discussion, I was reminded of a remarkable question that only future Mars colonization will answer: How will future Martians view our current stories about Mars and the people who live there? Will characters like John Carter, Sax Russell, Rebecca Sherman, Mark Watney and Bobbie Draper become modern myths to the new Martians? The exploration of Mars is the first instance of humans building a culture on top of a preexisting shared mythology in fiction. Will future Martians adopt that existing mythology as their own, or will they decide to make unto themselves a new one?We spent the rest of day relaxing around the hab, tending to our own experiments in the science dome and in GreenHab, and driving the NorCal Mars Society Rover around the hab (the rover was confronted by a 4 legged alien that retreated as soon as the rover advanced towards them. Photo of it is in the journalist report, awaiting identification). After sunset, sleet started to fall, and we settled in for a nice dinner and game night, featuring a custom card game designed for our mission by our Crew Journalist, Justin Mansell. The rules of “Mars Quest” are coming in a separate email if you want to follow along at home!Look Ahead Plan: The sleet has made the ground icy around the hab, and even though the weather for tomorrow is forecasted to be clear, we won’t do an EVA if the ground is icy. But if conditions permit, we plan to revisit the region North East of Maxwell Montes that we visited on EVA 3, as we believe we have found a walking route on the topo maps that would allow us to enter the mouth of the canyon from the south, and access the stratified layers we could previously only photograph from the canyon’s west rim.Anomalies in work: None (generator and water consumption issues believed to be resolved).Weather: 2C, light sleet, overcastCrew Physical Status: HealthyEVA: None.Reports to be filed: Sol Summary, Operations Report, Journalist Report, Greenhab Report, Astronomy Report, EVA Request"
crew 186 - 05/01/2018," Excited for our first scheduled R&RSol Activity Summary: We awoke today to Hans Zimmer’s “Elysium” from the movie Gladiator. Clouds had rolled in as forecasted, preventing the solar panels from being used for daytime power. The generator had failed during the night, and while it was easy to restart, it took a few attempts before it kept running for more than ~10 seconds. We suspect it simply had to warm up, but our reducing the hab power load before turning on the generator may have also helped. After breakfast, we prepared for our first 5 crew EVA to Greenstone Rd to continue the hunt for the hematite blueberries that had eluded us on our first and second EVA. After suit up and a brief radio discussion with Shannon, we decided to drop the navigation component of the EVA and focus on pure geology. Unfortunately, although we spent almost 3 hours on site with 5 pairs of eyes, and obtained multiple geological samples and spectra from around the area (including from the laser spectrometer generously lent to us by NASA Ames) we were not able to find any Hematite Blueberry formations. This evening, we got our first positive results from Sam’s microbe DNA experiment after swabbing around the hab. The PCR machine will continue to run throughout the night, and we eagerly await tomorrow’s results!Look Ahead Plan: To commemorate reaching the midpoint of our mission, tomorrow will be a light duty day of Hab upkeep and catching up on photo/video uploads and emails, followed by some R&R. No EVAs are planned for tomorrow.Anomalies in work: Generator failuresWeather: -2C, Winds E at 5 MPH, visibility 10 miles,Crew Physical Status: HealthyEVA: Greenstone Rd, 3.0 hrs, Geological sampling and search for hematite blueberriesReports to be filed: Sol Summary, Journalist Report, Operations Report, Science Report (Geology), Greenhab Report, EVA Report"
crew 186 - 04/01/2018," All nominalSol Activity Summary: Geologically, Earth’s moon has very little in common with Mars. The geological processes that have shaped the surface of our Moon (vulcanism and impacts) are very different than the geological processes that have shaped the surface of Mars (water and wind). But sitting in an intriguing middle ground are Mars’ moons, Phobos and Deimos. By most metrics, Mars’ moons are fairly typical asteroids, but their proximity to Mars has caused their surfaces to become blanketed in Martian material kicked up by asteroid strikes and swept up by the moons as they snowplow through the space surrounding the planet. As three members of our crew have done thesis level work on how hard it is to land on Mars, we are acutely aware that the first Mars sample return mission may not sample Mars at all, but rather, the impact debris that Mars has deposited onto its moons. In this theme, today a team composed of Cesare, Melanie, Sam and Mark conducted an EVA to the region 5 km North West of the Hab known as “The Moons” (Yellow Moon, Beige Moon, Gray Moon and White Moon). Last night, Cesare gave the entire crew a seminar on the geology of the surrounding area so we could be on the lookout for interesting features on geology EVAs like this one.We had originally budgeted time for three stops in the region for spectral measurements and sample collection, but the process of strapping the expensive and delicate equipment to our ATVs meant our estimates were incorrect, and we reached our turnaround time after only sampling one. So we must add this site to the increasingly long list of sites that will get a follow-up in a later EVA. Far more science to be done than scientists to do it will be part of a real mission to Mars, but it doesn’t make that constraint any easier to accept!When the EVA team returned, they were greeted by the sight of the NorCal Mars Society rover wheeling out to meet their ATVs. The rover was successfully navigated for three complete circuits of the campus while the team was out. The ideal Mars exploration mission will utilize robotic resources of every kind (orbital, airborne, and surface) and it’s good to have at least one of those joining our mission.This evening, Mark took us on a tour of GreenHab where the microgreens he planted 2 days ago are already starting to sprout. Flowers from GreenHab already adorn our dinner table, and near the end of our mission, we expect GreenHab’s food will too.Look Ahead Plan: In an attempt to check off our science goals more rapidly, tomorrow’s EVA will be a hybrid geology and navigation EVA along the southern end of Cow Dung Rd. The geology team will explore sites south of kissing camel ridge, and drop off the navigation team to attempt a walk back under limited visibility conditions with the navigation beacon.Anomalies in work: ATV 300 wouldn’t start this morning. We tried starting it again after returning from EVA, after it had been sitting in the sun for 2 hours, and it started up as expected.

crew 186 - 03/01/2018," Firmly into the routine of exploring Mars, even though there is nothing routine about it!Sol Activity Summary: We began with a marathon 4.5 hour EVA to a previously unexplored region near Maxwell Montes, leading to a remarkable box canyon with perfectly vertical stratified layers (see our Photo of the day). On the way back, we split up and successfully tested the navigation beacon meant to help a lost astronaut find their way back to the hab in poor visibility conditions. We also had our first successful use of the Hanksville Repeater “communication satellite” on EVA to bridge some of the regions where direct communication between the Hab and the EVA team was otherwise not possible. This was the first EVA to use all exo-suits, and they performed well beyond expectations (see EVA report). The evening discussion was occupied by important philosophical issues like whether ‘Dune” was best described as “Game of Thrones in Space” or if Game of Thrones was better described as “Dune in the Middle Ages.” Today is GreenHab Officer Mark’s birthday! Celebrations are planned for tonight to commemorate his becoming a preteen (in Mars years anyway).Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow is a medium length Geology EVA to White Moon, Beach Moon and Yellow Moon to the north of the hab. The Phoenix rover will also be put to work around the campus.Anomalies in work: Kinked fuel line running from the generator and apparent leak from under the Hab (see support requested and Operations report)Weather: 0C, Wind calm, Visibility 10 miles, Barometer 30.31 inHgCrew Physical Status: HealthyEVA: North East of Maxwell Montes, 4.5 hours, photographic survey and geological samplingReports to be filed: Sol Summary, Journalist Report, Greenhab Report, EVA #3 Report, EVA #4 Request, EVA #3 Request (see Commander’s note)"
crew 186 - 02/01/2018," All nominalSol Activity Summary: Our second day on Mars was opened with the slow-motion electrical chords of Vangelis theme from Chariots of Fire. After our morning Yoga, the second EVA team composed of Kshitij, Cesare, Mark, and Sam departed the airlock to search and sample the hematite blueberry formations at Goldstone Rd. that had eluded the first EVA team. While they were out, the remaining crew members caught up on Hab tasks, including Melanie dealing with a finicky battery charger, and Max watering our brand new Radish microgreens that Mark has spent the last few days preparing GreenHab for. The EVA team had a very successful (if exhausting) long duration EVA, stopping twice under Cesare’s guidance to sample interesting geological features. The hematite blueberries, alas, continued to evade us. Shannon: We formally request a hint.The connection to the Hanksville radio repeater we had hoped to use today for long-range communication wasn’t ready, so communications were lost between the EVA and Hab almost as soon as they rounded the corner, but the connection was fixed by the time they had returned, and we intend to use it to keep in touch on tomorrow’s EVA. The evening finished with Sam beginning his microbe sampling swabs around the hab, and an engineering EVA to move rover supplies from the RAM, along with a brand new load of soil for GreenHab that a friendly supply shuttle dropped right on our doorstep.Our crew has developed a new tradition which we have dubbed “The Idiot Box”. It is a box which we leave just outside the airlock all day, into which we put all the equipment which we will feel like an idiot for forgetting on our next EVA. That missing airlock fastener? That thermal probe? That EVA medical kit? Ask any one of us about any of these pieces of equipment and we will all give you the same answer: “Put it in the Idiot Box.”Look Ahead Plan: Our first non-geology EVA will take place tomorrow, with the three goals of photographing the as yet unvisited Maxwell Montes, testing our new long-range communications system with the Hanksville repeater, and testing the direction radio beacon for navigation.Anomalies in work: The new generator battery does not seem to be charging as expectedWeather: 0C, Winds W at 3MPH, Humidity 43%Crew Physical Status: HealthyEVA: Greenstone Rd take 2, 3.25 hrs, geological sampling for spectral analysisReports to be filed: Sol Summary, Journalist Report, Greenhab Report, EVA Report, EVA Request, Geology Report"

Kshitij led us in a Yoga routine that will become a daily occurrence for the rest of the mission. We had planned to finish our official crew portraits the previous evening, but sunset intervened, so we quickly donned the EVA suits this morning and stepped outside to capture our official crew portraits. On display were the flags of Purdue (our Alma Mater), our home countries, and the Tricolor-RGB of our new home planet.Breakfast was crepes smothered with Nutella and maple syrup, prepared by Justin and Mark. Over breakfast, we established the rules of our simulation, and what was expected of each of us to maintain its fidelity. With 15 minutes left until noon (when we would officially enter simulation), we all took the time to pay one last visit to the outside. At noon, we officially entered our simulation and began preparation for our first EVA: A geological sampling mission to the Greenstone Rd. area. Entering simulation late meant we had to return to the hab after only collecting one of the targeted 3 samples, but we will return tomorrow to complete it. Lunch was leftovers from last night’s new year’s feast (it was good enough to enjoy twice), followed by a dinner and witnessing a marvelous supermoon rise. Lunar astronomy on the supermoon is planned for tonight, as the weather looks clear.We are not the only ones who are feeling the Martian vibe. Even the habitat seems to be feeling it. For example, the generator’s 60Hz AC power seems to be running at ~61.6 Hz for some unknown reason. This is a harmless anomaly, but it means any appliance that gets its clock cycle from the AC power line will run 2.8% fast, accumulating an extra ~38 minutes per day. In other words, due to a technical error, our clocks are actually keeping within 0.2% of Martian time, and only the battery power analog clock on the wall is keeping Earth time… We have no intention of fixing this.Look Ahead Plan: Tomorrow’s EVA will target the two sample sites we were not able to visit today. Will also experiment with the use of the Hanksville repeater (aka, communications satellite) and our ham radio to avoid comm dropouts between EVA team and MDRS. Thank you comm for the warning this morning about the solar storm! We will deploy our own telescope tonight and plan for some solar astronomy tomorrow morning.Anomalies in work: EVA Airlock window was installed at the end of the EVA, but is currently secured with zip ties.

Ilaria and David took the car to buy a new battery for the generator, soil for the greenhab and food. Arno, Thibault and John set the laboratory with the 3D printer, the medical supplies, the X-1 spacesuit prototype, etc…This afternoon, we repaired the generator by replacing the battery and changing a part of the cooling liquid and the oil. It is working better at the moment when I write these lines! Hopefully, it will keep being in a good shape.We decided that we would begin the simulation tomorrow morning when waking up.

crew 185 - 15/12/2017,"It’s been a please working with all of you, and thanks for your help.It was a fitting send off to our team that our day started with agenerator failure. Upon our morning rounds after waking up it wasnoticed the Generator had failed with an ‘Underspeed’ Fault. We werehappy to see that SOC was holding steady at 100% (thank you solararrays!) but this was a worrying sign, especially as we didn’t want tohand over a crippled ship to the oncoming crew.Investigation into the generator showed that the loose connectionsthat were repaired previously were still holding strong, so there wasno immediate cause of the generator fault. After attempting torestart the generator a low battery voltage was observed (reading7.6volts, supposed to be 9.6 volts). It appears that after thegenerator failed it drained the battery down displaying the faultmessage on its status plate. After a jumpstart from our friendlyneighbors we were able to get the generator back up and running. Thisissue is likely to re-occur as we are still not sure of the originalcause. Our next step will be to Remove and Replace the generatorbatteries, fingers crossed this fixes the problem. Best of luck tofuture crews in continuing to troubleshoot this issue.Besides that morning excitement the day was one of cleaning andpacking, with a short break in the afternoon to do a short EVA aroundthe HAB for some last minute filming to get the shots we’ve missed sofar this mission.

crew 185 - 14/12/2017,"Today marks the end of our scientific mission and the completion of our three remaining scientific objectives.Our martian day sleep study ends tonight with a 4am bedtime, 12pm wake up.  Our team prepped extensively for this and arranged numerous protocols to handle crew fatigue and performance drop off due to tiredness.  Luckily we haven’t had to use any!  Our team has remained in good spirits and been able to keep to our sleep schedule well throughout our mission, with the occasional controlled nap being used to support a flagging crewmember!  We’ve focused on mentally demanding activities and music to keep the crew focused and alert in the evenings to allow us to hit our sleep targets.Today we successfully completed our last Matryoshka objective!  This was the farthest we’ve had to travel for an EVA, which is why we left it till last to capitalize on the experience we’ve gained in the past two weeks.  We took the Deimos Rover and an ATV to ensure we had sufficient range to meet our objectives and departed from the HAB at around 1pm, arriving at our objective at around 2pm in the Blue Hills area.  Our goal was to get samples from the ridgeline as it washed out into the plane of dirt to try to identify different materials in the mixing area between the cliffs and plains.  We successfully took samples from this area and several isolated hilltops in the area and packed up from or last EVA to return home.We weren’t going to get off easy however, as that hasn’t been our type of mission.  Due to user error when we started home the parking break was left on for ~ 5 minutes, which resulted in a precipitous power drop off from ~ 80% to 40%.  After the problem was noticed and corrected we discussed options.  The Blue Hills area is actually a fairly close walking distance from the HAB, but a long driving distance, so the decision was weather to leave the rover and walk back to the HAB or to take the long way around on the roads and trust the Rover to make it.  After assessing the fact that the Rover utilized ~ 20% battery to get to this location, had 40% remaining, and that we had a functioning ATV to get help if we broke down on the way we decided we had high confidence in getting the Rover back to the HAB and started the long drive back.  It made for an anxious drive back and frequent map checks to ensure we were going the right way but we managed to successfully coax Deimos back to the HAB just as the low battery light turned on at 20% SOC.  Another successful, and exciting, EVA!Today we completed our Anesthesia runs ‘for score’.  Under the supervision and evaluation of our resident doctor two crewmembers at a time formed a team and had to evaluate a test mold he has created to mimic a human leg.  Inside the mold the team must use the instructional videos and procedures provided to identify various components inside the mold (veins / arteries / nerves / etc. . .), identify the proper spot to apply anesthesia, then go through the process of delivering anesthesia to the leg.  Hopefully this research and experimentation makes good progress towards developing medical trainers that can be used with astronauts on a long duration mission that may not have anyone on board with medical expertise.Unfortunately cloud cover prevented any viewing of the Geminid meteor shower last night (of course the only cloudy night was the one with the meteor shower!)  It is currently clear and we intend to try again tonight to see if we can catch the tail end of the meteor shower.Tomorrow we focus on MDRS cleaning, packing, and transition to the next crew.  We will also be doing an EVA strictly in the environs of MDRS to get some last filming done as requested by our journalist.Sol Activity Summary:Matryoshka EVA Site #7aExerciseGeneral HAB Cleaning / Maintenance / ReportsAnesthesia ExperimentBeginning of cleanup / packing(Hopefully)  Telescope / Geminid Observation tonight due to clouds last night!Look Ahead Plan:EVA Filming around the HABSolar Observation / Observatory ShutdownMDRS CleaningLessons Learned CompilationEnd of Mission Food InventoryMission SummaryExerciseGeneral HAB Cleaning / Maintenance / ReportsAnomalies in work:1.    HAB Water Leak continues from under EVA door.  It appears to be getting worse.2.  Power System Misconfiguration ongoing.Weather: Warm (above freezing)Crew Physical Status: All crew in good physical health.EVA: See AboveReports to be filed:GreenhabOperationsSol SummaryJournalist"

crew 185 - 12/12/2017,"Today was a successful day and will hopefully  mark out the routine we will follow until the end of our mission.  The generator has been completely functional now for two days since our repairs over the weekend which is thankful news, our power problems seem to have abated themselves for the mission (though I may be jinxing myself. . . .).  In addition, the weather has been getting warmer which is a welcome relief and allows me to finally stop wearing my thermals, which is a welcome relief as they could sorely use a wash!We resumed this week’s round of Matryoshka EVAs with a successful visit and sample collection to Site #5.  Just two more sites to go and we will have completed our most important EVA objective of our mission.  We managed to collect several soil and rock samples from what appeared to look like river channels. We saw shiny glinting on the hills too and found some shale like specimens for analysis. All in all a successful EVA! One thing that has come about is the hazard of the strong sunlight in your face reducing visibility, as there is no sun visor on the helmet and sunglasses are not recommended. Luckily it caused no issues on this EVA, but could potentially be dangerous if sunglasses are to remain forbidden and visors are not added to EVA helmets.During the EVA return our EVA crew encountered a failure with the Deimos Rover.Deimos left the HAB at SOC 100% and was driven for ~ 45 minutes to the site with no issues.When returning from EVA site Deimos started experiencing significant mechanical drag that both lowered the achievable rover speed and increased battery drain.  This problem persisted for roughly 30 minutes until the Rover was able to return to base.  From the onset of the problem it was roughly steady until the turn was made off of cowdung road to return to the HAB.  At that time Rover performance precipitously dropped and was able to achieve little more than walking speed.  Steering was also noticed to be stiff during the return from EVA site.The EVA crew reports that from a driving perspective it felt like the parking break was on, though visual inspection showed this was not actually the case.  The root cause of the issue was not determined though we will do an inspection during tomorrows EVA.  We suspect the issue may be due to debris in Deimos’s drive train.At the end of the EVA Deimos was at 29% which is unusual given Deimos’s long range and is likely related to the experienced ‘drag’ when driving Deimos.For the folks left behind today we were primarily occupied with Solar observation which showed numerous impressive features that made observing a treat.  The sun is waking up!  Hopefully it stays active for the next few days and into the next mission.We are entering the period of our mission where our Martian Sleep Schedule has moved our days ‘out of phase’ with Earth normal.  Tonight we will be going to sleep at 2:40am and waking up at 10:40am.  We have been primarily occupying our nights with cleaning, Bricks, Anesthesia training, and general maintenance to prepare ourselves to fully utilize the next day’s daylight hours.  Our team has adjusted to the schedule well so far with crew taking naps as needed to stay on schedule.Thanks for your help!Sol Activity Summary:Matryoshka EVA Site #5‘Bricks’ communication experimentSolar ObservationExerciseGeneral HAB Cleaning / Maintenance / ReportsEVA Suit Inspection / MaintenanceLook Ahead Plan:Matryoshka EVA Site #6‘Bricks’ communication experimentSolar ObservationAnesthesia Experiment RunsExerciseGeneral HAB Cleaning / Maintenance / ReportsDeimos TroubleshootingAnomalies in work:1.    HAB Leak from under EVA door (not noticeable today)2.  Power System Misconfiguration ongoing.3.  Deimos Rover (see above)Weather: MildCrew Physical Status: All crew in good physical health.EVA: See AboveReports to be filed:GreenhabOperationsEVA RequestSol SummaryJournalistAstronomyHSO"
crew 185 - 11/12/2017,"Today has been a thankfully nominal day!  Due to our error with comm’s yesterday and not getting our EVA request in on time we stayed at MDRS and concentrated on catching up on HAB maintenance and other activities that have fallen by the wayside in the last few days.Today we completed our crew training on our ultrasound machine, which enables us to complete our practice runs with the Astronaut trainer developed by Dr. Sczepaniak in the next few days.We were informed of some likely solar activity by our friendly neighborhood astronomer which led us to perform some highly anticipated solar observation this afternoon.  While we could not detect any prominence we did detect sunspots for the first time.  We are hoping the sun continues in this period of high activity and future solar observation yields some rewarding images.We continued with our communication experiment and have noticed significant improvement among the crew in terms of numbers of errors and completion times in our building tasks.  We have assembled a lesson’s learned list of communication tips to allow quick and efficient communication among various types of time delay.  We will continue this experiment in various permutations until our mission ends, and then expect to hand over our experiment materials to make this a permanent installation at MDRS that crews can participate in as desired.We also completed our CPR techniques experiment runs on all crew, analyzing the various ways that more force than body weight can be utilized during a CPR medical emergency.  It was interesting that most crew actually utilized different techniques during this experiment run, with us comparing notes to identify the optimal method.Our crew has returned to our exercise routine today with all exercise equipment completely assembled.  This has proven to be a crew favorite and we also intend to donate this equipment to MDRS.  We have assembled a stationary exercise bike and a series of medicine balls for weights exercises.The remainder of the day was filled with HAB maintenance, static water tank transfer, cleaning, some much needed love for our friendly plants in the Greenhab, and assembly of equipment delivered by Mission Control.  We are excited to finish out our mission and eager to get back out into the Martian environment with our 5th Matryoshka experiment site tomorrow.Thanks for your assistance!Sol Activity Summary:Matryoshka EVA Site #5‘Bricks’ communication experimentSolar ObservationCPR TechniquesExerciseGeneral HAB Cleaning / Maintenance / ReportsEVA Suit Inspection / MaintenanceWashvac AssemblyPower system monitoringGreenhab PlantingAnesthesia Ultrasound TrainingStatic Water Tank TransferLook Ahead Plan:Matryoshka EVA Site #5‘Bricks’ communication experimentSolar ObservationCPR TechniquesExerciseGeneral HAB Cleaning / Maintenance / ReportsAnomalies in work:1.      HAB Leak from under EVA door continuing (per Mission Control leak is expected and has been present for months, presumed to be from Kitchen piping)2.  Power System Misconfiguration ongoing.  Generator turned off ~ 10am.  SOC stayed close to 100% all day long.3.  EVA Suit Malfunctions – See Operations ReportWeather: Cold, clearCrew Physical Status: All crew in good physical health.EVA: N/AReports to be filed:GreenhabOperationsEVA RequestSol SummaryJournalistAstronomy"

crew 184 - 07/12/2017,"  The past two days have been hectic due to getting in to the swing of things on Mars and the numerous failures we have encountered.  As a consequence, our schedule fell by the wayside and we were largely winging it.  Yesterday we sat down, came to a stable configuration, discussed our lessons learned from our stay so far, and prepared to jump back onto our schedule.We are still dealing with our power system failure, but today has been a day of focus where our team is efficiently moving from task to task and completing our assigned activities.We’ve learned today that the low battery SOC we’ve been seeing since our mission started is likely due to a misconfigured battery panel.  Mission Control is seeking help to reprogram it and return our power system to nominal.  In the meantime we will continue to minimize power usage.  Due to SOC ~ 35% it is possible we lose power tonight, our team has prepared for this eventuality and everyone is prepared to handle the cold if necessary, and all team members have light sources on hand overnight.  We have also filled reserve containers with water due the expectation that if power is lost pipes will freeze overnight.Power system is still smart enough to accept power from generator once SOC starts dropping overnight.  System Nominal!Power system swaps to generator power.  Generator Failure overnight due to the cold.  Expected loss of power overnightPower System misconfiguration prevents accepting generator power.  Expected loss of power overnight.In the meantime, activities!This morning we have completed Anesthesia training for all crewmembers.  On a long duration mission it is critical crews know how to treat any injuries or other problems that arise, as part of this devising methods of training for crew on a long duration mission is critical.  Our Dr. has devised a mold that simulates arteries / nerves / and veins in a leg that allows crew to practice using ultrasound equipment to identify and isolate specific body parts.  With the training complete crew will be able to complete trial runs where we see how effective this is a training device and how crew performance increases over time.We also completed our third Matryoshka EVA to SIte #3.  We continue to collect geological samples from our target sites, though this is the first day that our crew is starting to feel the fatigue from EVA, which is hard work!.  Today’s site was exceptionally rocky which gave a very ‘martian’ feel.Our crew is looking forward to the weekend which we have schedule as ‘light duty’ days to allow ourselves to recuperate from a very busy week!Sol Activity Summary:1.      Matryoshka EVA Site #32.      Observatory Operation3.      Anesthesia Training4.      Reports and general HAB maintenance / checks5.      Food inventory transfer to excel and submission to6.      Exercise7.  Brick Experiment8.  Power System Monitoring9.  Receipt and stowage of supply drop10.  CPR techniques (ME-3)11.  Media Visit CancelledLook Ahead Plan:Matryoshka EVA Site #4ANAM Winscat BaselineMusk ObservationCPR TecniquesBrick ExperimentFilming and InterviewsExercise / General HAB MaintenanceAnomalies in work:1.      HAB Leak from under EVA door continuing (per Mission Control leak is expected and has been present for months, presumed to be from Kitchen piping)2.  Power System MisconfigurationWeather: Still cold (below freezing).Crew Physical Status: All crew in good physical health.EVA: See above for EVA detailsReports to be filed:GreenhabOperationsEVA RequestJournalistAstronomySol Summary"
crew 184 - 06/12/2017,"  We are still waiting for a nominal morning!  To fix yesterday’s bandwidth problems we powered off all devices in the HAB, we then connected our ‘internet’ laptop to the modem and watched 100MB of bandwidth disappear in ~ 5 minutes.  We concluded there was a background process of some sort operating on that computer as no known programs were running.  We were able to fix this issue by swapping out this laptop and powering down the fault one.  Communication restored!We exulted in this victory for approximately 10 minutes, then noticed that our generator had failed again and we were back to a powerdown configuration.  Our SOC was holding at 47%, but it was again clear that we were operating with a degraded power system.  Communication with Mission Control has tentatively identified the problem as due to a ‘summer fuel’ blend which has been noted before, which is separate from the oil leak we observed earlier.  The generator will likely continue to be faulty for the next few days until we can procure a ‘winter’ blend.  Winters on Mars can be tough!.  We are continuing to conserve power wherever possible and using the generator minimally to supplement the solar arrays when required.We resumed nominal operations this afternoon with two primary activitiesWe decided to finish up the EVA that we left incomplete yesterday, going to Matryoshka Site #2 which is adjacent to the MDRS HAB.  Our EVA prep procedure continues to be challenging, but we are getting better.  We have allocated the best radios and headsets for EVA (recently delivered!) and placed them adjacent to the EVA prep room.  We have also pre-staged all EVA equipment (boots / gloves / first aid kid / emergency water supply / maps / etc . . . ) in the EVA room to minimize the chance that our prebreathe is interrupted by having to go out to the HAB to get supplies.  We have also started carrying backup radios with us since we have had to cut an EVA short due to radios running out of batteries.  The EVA training continues!Once outside we successfully found samples from numerous geological strata in our target era and bagged them for later delivery and chemical analysis.  We had some excess time upon returning so we also took some of the PR images requested and will uplink them as part of the journalist report.When the majority of the crew got back to the habitat we did an observatory training sessions where the crew astronomy gave a tutorial in observatory and telescope operation.  There’s something about being on Mars that gives observatory operations extra gravitas as you are already in the ‘space’ mindset.Sol Activity Summary:1.      Matryoshka EVA Site #22.      Observatory Training Session (no observing)3.      HAB Cleaning4.      Reports and general HAB maintenance / checks5.      Food inventory transfer to excel6.      ExerciseLook Ahead Plan:Matryoshka EVA Site #3Nerve Block TrainingCBS News Visit (unconfirmed – request confirmation on whether media crew is coming from Mission Support)Filming and InterviewsSolar ObservationCommunication Experiment (Time Delay)CPR Technique TrainingExercise / General HAB MaintenanceAnomalies in work:1.      HAB Leak from under EVA door (per Mission Control leak is expected and has been present for months, presumed to be from Kitchen piping)2.      Generator failure3.      Internet bandwidth problem was resolved today.Weather: Still cold (below freezing), slightly windyCrew Physical Status: All crew in good physical health.EVA: See above for EVA detailsReports to be filed:GreenhabOperationsEVA RequestJournalistAstronomySol Summary"
crew 184 - 05/12/2017,"  Today was a hectic day with three major failures ourteam dealt with.1.    Internet – Between 8:30am and 9:30am 800MB of bandwidth wasutilized. It is unknown what caused this but likely culprit was adevice being left on and doing a software update in the background.Internet communication was lost at this time.  These reports are beingdelivered by Shannon today.2.    Water – During our morning fill of the loft tank the pumpwas non-functional.  Possible causes were quickly narrowed down toeither a frozen pipe due to the below freezing temperatures or aclogged filter. Our team immediately switched to using bottled waterwhich we keep as an emergency reserve while we troubleshot the issue.At 1pm we called Mission Control for advice who recommended we connectthe pipe heating system and wait till midday, this resolved the issuearound 3pm and water was restored to the HAB3.    Power – During our morning check of SOC it was noted thatthe generator was not running, having failed sometime during thenight, and that SOC was at 3%.  We immediately instituted a shutdownof MDRS powered equipment to preserve what little power we had andinvestigated the generator.  It was noted that a significant oil leakhad developed from the oil cap, upon tightening the cap the leakstopped and the generator was restarted.  When returning to thescience dome it was observed that SOC was hovering around 10% and didnot appear to be charging.  After consultation with Mission Control itwas discovered that the generator was in idle due to the power systemnot requesting it to go to full delivered power given the fact thatthe solar array system was charging the battiers (however slowly) .In addition the SOC was likely incorrect due to it being a calculatedvalue and us confusing it due to going off scale.  We will assess SOCtonight after a full day in the sun and decide forward plan.Our morning was mostly consumed with maintenance and troubleshooting,we quickly discovered that when receiving failures our level ofknowledge of the systems was exhausted in how to troubleshoot,recommend future crew get access to and study manuals for MDRSequipment prior to stay.In the afternoon when we got our facilities in a stable configuratrionfour members of our team went on our first Matryoshka EVA. We wereable to go to the Kissing Camel ridge and collect two samples, howeverwe were unable to go to the other site in URC South due to delays ingetting out since we had to fix our non-nominal systems.The two sample we collected were to highlight interestinggeomorphological features to be used in outreach activities back inOxford. The strike and dip of the ridge component the first sample wasextracted from was also taken. The intention of sample collection andstrike and dip measurement is to determine whether satellite andoutcrop scale imagery data is reliable at predicting these.Sol Activity Summary:1.    Troubleshooting and EVA as discussed above2.    Exercise3.    Assembling of exercise equipment using martian dirt(medicine ball complete!)4.    HAB Cleaning5.    Solar observationLook Ahead Plan:With internet down we are unable to contact our scheduling team.  Wewill receive the schedule in the morning when internet bandwidthrestarts and go over it as a team to plan our day.Anomalies in work:1.    Yamaha 250 ATV #3 wheel deemed non-recoverable.  We haveparked it off to the side for mission support.  Photos of damageattached.Weather: Very cold!  It was below freezing for most of the day.Crew Physical Status: All in good health.EVA: Delayed due to non-nominal systems, so we are requesting the sameEVA from Sol 3 but just for site A (mound on URC South) to finish offthe sample collection.

crew 184 - 04/12/2017," Today really felt like our first day on mars. It was our first full activity day as well as our first day on EVA! Surprisingly it was consensus among our crew that our first full day was actually the easiest day we’ve had so far! I think the excitement of going outside and our team getting into the swing of things has really made us more efficient.The primary activity for the day was an EVA on all crew to familiarize ourselves with EVA procedures, suit functionality, and operation of the rovers. Many lessons were learned, and it was good that we got the kinks out on a EVA solely suited to it. This will allow our scientific EVAs to be successful later on, as well as ensure that we can safely perform EVAs at a farther distance from the habitat.Our team is following a specific protocol for depress / repress operations modeled after ISS EVAs. Our team is doing a 25 minute prebreathe in the EVA Prep room to prevent decompression sickness, once complete we are doing a 5 minute depressurization in the actual airlock. During repress we are allocating 5 minutes for repressurization options, though we have the capability to do an ’emergency repress’ if needed at the risk of rupturing crew eardrums.Below are the several lessons learned we had during EVA.Peripheral vision is nearly non-existent when wearing the EVA helmets. This makes it difficult to travel together in an ATV convoy as it is impossible to turn around and check on the status of those behind you. We attempted to mitigate this by placing the radios in VOX and keeping in constant voice contact to maintain proper spacing, we also played ‘leapfrog’ with the ATV’s where the leader would stop after several minutes of driving to allow the two behind him to catch up and pass, ensuring no-one was left behind.We had several communication failures during EVA due to earpieces falling out of ears. We addressed this via using medical tape to secure the earpieces in place.We had to abort a prebreathe operation due to forgetting to bring supplies into the EVA Prep room. We instituted a supply check prior to closing the Prep Room door. If necessary to break EVA prebreathe protocol we do a 3 to 1 buy back, i.e. if you break prebreathe for 5 minutes, you add 15 minutes to prebreathe to compensate.Several of our crew members are trained scuba divers. We found that it was difficult to hear other EVA crew while driving the ATV due to engine and wind noise, we instituted a series of hand signals to allow non-verbal communication which quickly and concisely allowed EVA crew status to be conveyed.Do not wear high pony tails – recommend low braid. A high braid interferes with the way that your head can move within the EVA helmet and vision is confined to roughly a 45 degree angle down and lower.During the high winds today we heard a bang as the outer airlock door was blown open. The inner airlock door held closed and thus we didn’t all die! We immediately closed the door to the EVA Prep room to form a second seal to the martian atmosphere. During tomorrows familiarization EVA we will enter the EVA Prep room, close the EVA Prep room door, and use that as a depressurization chamber. Immediately upon departure on tomorrows EVA we will repair the outer airlock door.We also completed our first scientific objectives today, covered below.Reduced Gravity CPR Experiment: When on Mars there is a possible complication when performing CPR. With your body weight reduced the typical CPR techniques are non functional due to reduced force on the recipient. Our team is practicing techniques under the supervision of our medical officer to allow force application in excess of body weight and measuring output using a springed scaled.Communication Delay ‘Bricks’ Experiment: Our first two experiment runs of the brick experiment were performed. We started with a 0 time delay baseline, and increased to a 9 minute time delay with verbal information transfer (martian time delay). Our runs will continue to collect more data and determine the most efficient methods of information transfer.We also completed some major maintenance tasks todayThe Musk Observatory has been set up and put through it’s paces and is ready for operation.Trailer Tank to Static Water Tank transfer operation – Crew completed the transfer this morning completely filling our static water tank.

crew 183 - 01/12/2017,"Today, we spent most of our time at the hab. At long last, Curtis arrives to fix the water heater in the hab, which has been out of commission for over a month now. He also insulated the water pipes and the outside tank. This morning, I was able to start my final batch of Sedimentation tests. All that’s left are my salinity & pH tests for all the soils.Meanwhile, Chris offered to help put the rovers together. We now have three out of the four new rovers fully assembled.At about 4:00 PM, I took a short EVA to Tank wash to resupply on a couple of samples that I needed.Look Ahead Plan:Tomorrow morning, Curtis will deliver and install Shannon’s water tank tomorrow, Shannon and I will be preparing the Lab and the Hab for Crew 184’s arrivalAnomalies in work: No ProblemsWeather: Clear, warm, calm windsCrew Physical Status: OK, HealthyEVA: Tank Wash areaReports to be Filed:-Operations Report"
crew 183 - 30/11/2017,"Today, I spent from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, exploring the area south of Kissing Camel Range. I’d estimate that I covered anywhere from 6-8 km during that time frame. There were many interesting areas that I found, such as a couple of caves that a person can walk into. Although I didn’t find any dinosaur bones out there, I did find a lot of petrified wood. During this time, Shannon managed to complete the MDRS user manual that she’s been working on.Between 3:00 PM & 5:00 PM, Shannon and I explored the last of the unchecked roads we still needed to check up on.Look Ahead Plan:Tomorrow, Curtis and his team will come and fix the water heater. Shannon and I will clean up the Lab for Crew 184.Anomalies in work: No ProblemsWeather: Clear, warm, calm windsCrew Physical Status: OK, HealthyEVA: Region South of Kissing Camel Range & Road explorationReports to be Filed:-Operations Report"
crew 183 - 29/11/2017,"Today, I set off to explore the area to the South of Kissing Camel Range and West of Cow Dung Rd. First I investigated some of the washes crossing the road to see what I could find. In the first wash that I stopped in, I found pieces of petrified wood amongst other very interesting specimens. I’ll definitely have to explore this drainage basin later.From there, I proceeded further south, until I reached a large wash near White Rock Canyon. I only walked about 2 minutes up, when I found a very large specimen that looked like mineralized bone marrow. Compared to the basalt ejecta littering the wash, this specimen looked completely different. The holes were all aligned in the same direction, and were about the same size. The basalt pieces had gas bubbles, but were of random size, with no obvious pattern. The size of the marrow was very large, with 3-4 mm spacing. If this was indeed a piece of a dinosaur bone, then that meant there is a very large dinosaur fossil somewhere in that drainage basin.I left the specimen where I found it, planning to come back and visit later. After spending over 2 hours in this area, I didn’t find much more, though there is still quite a bit of ground to cover. I returned to the hab by around 2:00 PM, and informed Shannon on what I had found. On our way to town, we investigated the specimen that I had found in the wash. Shannon wasn’t sure what it was, but we confirmed that there weren’t any other rocks in that area that looked like it.  She figured that if it was indeed a remnant of a dinosaur bone, that it would have to come from a very large dinosaur, much larger than a Utahraptor or velociraptor. We plan on surveying this area further to see what we can find.Soon after, we ran into town, found a socket wrench kit that would work with the bolts on the new rovers, and organized the next supply of food for Crew 184. We returned to hab after finishing our business in town.Look Ahead Plan:Tomorrow and the day after, I will be extensively searching the drainage basin where I found that specimen for large fossil exposures. Since Shannon told me that she hasn’t extensively explored this area, what I may find there could be very interesting.Anomalies in work: No ProblemsWeather: Clear, warm, calm windsCrew Physical Status: OK, HealthyEVA:Reports to be Filed:-Operations Report"
crew 183 - 28/11/2017,"This was the last day for Crew 183. They packed the last of their belongings and headed off, back to Earth. After eating breakfast, Shannon and I started assembling the new rovers. It took over an hour to get just one close to being ready to go, as the rovers didn’t come with assembly instructions. Unfortunately, we don’t have a socket wrench that is compatible with the large bolts used with the rovers. Hopefully we’ll be able to find a socket large enough to work.At around 2:30 PM, we headed off to Cactus Rd, to rediscover a road that was thought to be lost and forgotten to time. Our goal was to see if this area could be accessed and explored by future EVAs. It was obvious it hadn’t been used by ATVs or rovers in years, as the most prominent tracks were from cows. The cow tracks made the road extremely bumpy, slowing our progress significantly.Once we reached the end, we found a wonderful place to access the Summerville Formation, an easy 100 meter walk. There were these red and yellow pieces of chert-like rocks scattered everywhere that could be petrified dinosaur poop.Once we finished here, we made our way to the end of Yellow Zebra road and found an amazing place for future EVAs. This area could easily take several hours to explore adequately. As it got closer to dark, we made our way back to the Hab, and I resumed my soil analysis in the Lab.Look Ahead Plan:Tomorrow, we plan to gather food supplies for the next incoming crew. I also intend to start exploring the region south of Kissing Camel range, to see if I find anything interesting. There is also a road in the area we conducted our EVA today that we still need to explore, called Maxwell Montes Rd. We may either do this tomorrow or sometime before Saturday, when Crew 184 arrives.Anomalies in work: No ProblemsWeather: Clear, warm, calm windsCrew Physical Status: OK, HealthyEVA: End of Cactus Rd & Yellow Zebra RdReports to be Filed:-Operations Report"

crew 182 - 17/11/2017," Or is this just fantasy? Today we met with Survivorman, also known as Les Stroud. A pretty calm guy with really interesting experiences around the world. Both he and the cameramen were great and we had a great time. But first, let’s explain how our day started: It was just a normal day… expecting the arrival of Survivorman, but a normal day none-the less. We asked again about the pancakes and all those things that became inside jokes around the crew. And then we realized: Man, this will be our last night in MDRS, right? The thought is kind of frightening… specially for me, because I need to do an exposition in my University about some paper I haven’t even read. I would like to stay in MDRS at least a little bit longer. The bacterias I cultivated here have so many different shapes and colors, it is quite exciting for me as a wanna-be microbiologist.After the philosophical moment, Survivorman arrived! Fortunately, we planned an EVA today, one where yours truly participated. We went to the Lith canyon. The new ATVs were great, but the trekking there got tiring after a while. We were so tired that some crewmembers here made some associations with Igor the donkey of Winnie the Pooh (Get it? There’s a place called after Pooh, so we think about Winnie the Pooh characters… ok, maybe that’s another inside joke). The cameramen started filming us, and I must say they got nice shots. That Lith Canyon place is absolutely beautiful and so interesting. It had so much geological material and the plants there were thrilling! I will always be amazed by how life still goes on even in such places as deserts.We arrived to the hab with the filmcrew and decided to take some lunch. But, before that, we decided to do what we were expecting since day one: Eating the russian space food that they sent so gently to us. We were waiting for Survivorman to make this even more epic. And there we were, holding our toothpaste-like tubes to our mouths, tasting the meat and the apple pure. I must say that I liked both, but some of the guys just couldn’t get around with the new flavour. Anyways, it was quite a shocking experience.After a nice lunch at the hab, we finally got some rest. I had to do some work at the lab, but the guys stayed here to help bring in the new food for the next crew.I still can’t believe this will be our last day at MDRS. But I’m glad I had the chance to get to know the crewmembers, as well as Survivorman, the people of Mars Society we got to know (yes, even the Capcoms) and, of course, the desert.Maybe a proper thank you wouldn’t be enough, y’know? But at least I have a story to tell my grandchildren in the future, with some good pancakes.Look Ahead Plan: Our homes are waiting in our respective countries, so as long as we arrive on time and safely, that’s the only plan we have.Anomalies in work: Nope.Weather: Windy and with some rain.Crew Physical Status: Very well.EVA: Most of our EVA is explained in the summary.

crew 181 - 02/11/2017," The rest of the crew were up and outside workingwhen I arrived.  We worked on the tunnel until about 10 am, when astrange vehicle drove up.  We had a media visit from Voice of America,and I was their interviewee and there I was, looking much as I usuallydo at MDRS, oh so fashionable (stop laughing, all you people who knowme), with my hair a spectacular mess!  I did get to brush my teethbefore filming.  It went very well, in the end, although I normallytry my best to get out of being on camera.  This will be a series ofvideos broadcast in Russia.  We continued to work throughout the day,and although the afternoons are supposed to be free time, thisdedicated group just kept working.  We were going to have pizza fordinner, but our order did not get to the person who was cooking them,so we ended up with a bunch of wonderful junk food instead.Look Ahead Plan:  We need to get water here for the crew who arrive onSaturday, so that will be our big push tomorrow.Anomalies in work:  I noticed that this afternoon, with full sun, ourstate of charge on the solar system was 53%, which is considerablylower that it has been.  There was no real extra pull on the powersupply today, so I’m not sure what happened.  With the generatorcurrently non-functional we are dependent on the solar only.  I amhoping DG will be able to work on the generator before the crewarrives.  Also we cannot find the hitch for the HabCar.Weather:  The weather continues to be unusually warm and pleasant.This evening the wind has kicked up a little more than yesterday, butit’s still a nice day.  Almost full moon tonight.Crew Physical Status:  Dirtier, and a little tired.EVA: No EVAsReports to be file: Sol Summary and Engineering Report.
